Based on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis 

Fourth Draft 
November 1998


INT. PASTELS RESTAURANT- NIGHT 

An insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side. 
The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged 
silk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths 
decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous 
exotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and 
confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style: 
pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Alaïa, Armani power suits.

CLOSE-UP on a WAITER reading out the specials.

WAITER 
With goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula 
Caesar salad. For entrées tonight I have a swordfish 
meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge 
breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale...

Huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen 
table cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four 
inches square and look exactly alike.

CLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of 
conversation. "Is that Charlie Sheen over there?" "Excuse 
me? I ordered cactus pear sorbet."

WAITER 
And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our 
pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...

CLOSE-UP on porcelain plates containing elaborate 
perpendicular desserts descending on another table.

PATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID 
VAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing 
expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back 
hair. Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses. 

The camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins:

BATEMAN (V.O.)
We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California 
place on the Upper East Side.

The Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately 
decorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's 
description of each of the men at the table.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in 
a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences 
between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van 
Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the 
best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a 
bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten 
keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress . 

VAN PATTEN 
What are the rules for a sweater vest?

McDERMOTT 
What do you mean?

PRICE 
Yes. Clarify.

McDERMOTT 
Well, is it strictly informal-

BATEMAN 
Or can it be worn with a suit?

McDERMOTT 
(Smiling) 
Exactly

BATEMAN 
With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or 
charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder 
vest.

McDERMOTT 
But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or
tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look 
too studied.

VAN PATTEN 
You think so?

PRICE 
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.

VAN PATTEN 
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.

Van Patten leaves the table. As he does so, a busboy 
discreetly removes their largely untouched plates.

BATEMAN 
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?

PRICE 
It looks that way, doesn't it?

McDERMOTT 
(Staring at retreating waiter) 
Did he just take our plates away?

PRICE 
He took them away because the portions are so small he 
probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place. 
This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?

McDERMOTT 
Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head.
(He guffaws)

Bateman throws a swizzle stick at him.

McDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man
with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses.

McDERMOTT 
Is that Reed Robinson over there?
PRICE 
Are you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson.

McDERMOTT 
Who is it then?

PRICE 
That's Paul Owen.

BATEMAN 
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the
room. Over there.

He points to another handsome young man with slicked-back 
hair and horn-rimmed glasses.

McDERMOTT 
Who is he with?

PRICE 
(Distracted by the waitress's 
cleavage as she bends over to 
uncork a bottle of wine – the 
waitress glares at him) 
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

Van Patten returns.

VAN PATTEN 
They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.

McDERMOTT 
Are you sure that's Paul Owen over there?

PRICE 
Yes. McDufus, I am.

McDERMOTT 
He's handling the Fisher account.

PRICE 
Lucky bastard.

McDERMOTT 
Lucky Jew bastard.

BATEMAN 
Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with 
anything?

McDERMOTT 
Listen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the
phone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah. The 
bastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December.

BATEMAN 
You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah. 
You spin a dreidel.

McDERMOTT 
Oh my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up
some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?

BATEMAN 
No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.

McDERMOTT 
Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the 
ACLU.

Price leans over and pats Bateman on the back.

PRICE 
The voice of reason. The boy next door. And speaking 
of reasonable...

He shows McDermott the bill for the meal.

McDERMOTT 
Only $470.

VAN PATTEN 
(Without irony) 
Not bad.

The others murmur agreement. Four platinum Amex cards slap
down on the table.

INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 
Bateman is pouring vintage champagne into flutes. Price is 
lighting up a cigar.

McDERMOTT 
Last week I picked up this Vassar chick-

VAN PATTEN 
Oh God, I was there. I don't need to hear this 
story again.

McDERMOTT 
But I never told you what happened afterwards. So 
okay, I pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big 
tits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so I 
buy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on 
spring break and she's practically blowing me in the 
Chandelier Room and so I take her back to my place-

BATEMAN 
Whoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is during all 
this?

McDERMOTT 
Oh fuck you. I want a blowjob, Bate-man. I want a chick 
who's gonna let me-

VAN PATTEN 
(Putting his hands over his ears) 
I don't want to hear this. He's going to say something 
disgusting.

McDERMOTT 
You prude. Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op 
together or jet down to Saint Bart's. I just want some 
chick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes.

Price throws a cigar at McDermott, who catches it.

McDERMOTT 
Anyway, so we're back at my place and listen to 
this. She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking 
rhino tipsy, and get this-

VAN PATTEN 
She let you fuck her without a condom?

McDERMOTT 
This is a Vassar girl. She's not from Queens. She 
would only-are you ready? 
(Dramatic pause) 
She would only give me a handjob, and get this...she kept 
her glove on.

The men sit in shocked, horrified silence.

ALL IN UNISON Never date a Vassar girl.

EXT. TUNNEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

The limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the Tunnel. 
McDermott holds the door open for a passing HOMELESS MAN, 
who looks confused.

McDERMOTT 
I suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask 
him if he takes American Express.

PRICE 
(Offering card) 
You take Amex, dude?

The man stumbles away. The club DOORMAN, seeing the limousine, 
unhooks the 
velvet rope and welcomes them inside.

INT. LADIES ROOM, TUNNEL - NIGHT 

Brilliant white light, a bemused elderly female attendant in a 
black-and-white maid's uniform trying to give out paper towels. 
MUSIC thuds through an open doorway. Trashed-looking girls 
stare into mirrors repairing their eye make-up or sit on the 
counter chatting to friends. There are almost as many men as 
women in the room. Couples stand in line, twitching as they 
wait to do coke. As soon as one bathroom door opens, a couple 
lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes 
past them and slams the door.

PRICE 
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the 
AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, 
then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular 
dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for 
Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-

BATEMAN 
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a 
virus.

PRICE 
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.

Price and Bateman finally get a stall and rush in. Price is 
sweating.

PRICE 
I'm shaking. You open it.

Bateman opens a tiny packet of coke.

PRICE
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?

BATEMAN 
Maybe it's just the light.

PRICE 
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? (He dips 
the corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort) 
Oh my God...

BATEMAN 
What?

PRICE 
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!

Bateman dips his Amex in the envelope and snorts.

BATEMAN 
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do 
enough of it we'll be okay.

PRICE 
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it 
on my fucking All-Bran.

The GUY IN STALL next door yells at them in an effeminate 
voice:

GUY IN STALL 
Could you keep it down, I'm trying to do drugs!

Price pounds his fist against the stall.

PRICE 
(screaming) 
SHUT UP!

BATEMAN 
Calm down. Let's do it anyway

PRICE 
I guess you're right...
(Raising his voice) 
THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!

GUY IN STALL 
Fuck you!

PRICE 
(Trying to climb up against the aluminum divider) 
No, FUCK YOU!! 
(He collapses, panting against the stall door) 
Sorry, dude. Steroids...Okay, let's do it.

BATEMAN 
That's the spirit.

They both dig their platinum Amex cards into the envelope 
of white powder, shoveling it up their noses, then sticking 
their fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it into 
their gums.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 

Bateman saunters toward the bar as "Pump Up the Volume" 
plays in the background.

BATEMAN (to BARGIRL) Two Stoli on the rocks.

He hands her two drink tickets.

BARGIRL 
It's after eleven. Those aren't good anymore. It's 
a cash bar. That'll be twenty-five dollars.

Bateman pulls out an expensive-looking wallet and hands her 
a $50.

She turns her back and searches the cash register for 
change.

BATEMAN You are a fucking ugly bitch I want to stab to 
death and then play around with your blood.

The music muffles his voice. She turns around. He is 
smiling at her. She gives him his change impassively.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT- MORNING 

Tableaux of Bateman's apartment in the early morning light. 
A huge white living room with floor-to-ceiling windows 
looking out over Manhattan, decorated in expensive, minimalist 
high style: bleached oak floors, a huge white sofa, a large 
Baselitz painting (hung upside down) and much expensive 
electronic equipment. The room is impeccably neat, and oddly 
impersonal - as if it had sprung straight from the pages of 
a design magazine.

BATEMAN (V.0.) 
My name is Patrick Bateman. I am 
twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden 
Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh 
floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse.

Bateman walks into his bathroom, urinates while trying to 
see his reflection in a poster for Les Miserables above his 
toilet.

BATEMAN 
(V.0.) I believe in taking care of myself, in a 
balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the 
morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice 
pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand 
now.

Bateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face.

Bateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living 
room wearing the ice pack.

CUT TO:

A mirror-lined bathroom. Bateman is luxuriating in the 
shower steam, scrubbing his body, admiring his muscles.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
After I remove the icepack, I use a deep 
pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a 
water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body 
scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.

Bateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a 
gel facial masque.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which 
I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my 
routine.

Bateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet, which is 
stocked with immaculate rows of skin care products. He 
begins selecting bottles jars and brushes, laying them in 
readiness on the marble counter.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I always use an after-shave lotion with little 
or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes 
you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye 
balm, followed by a final moisturizing "protective" lotion...

Bateman stares into the mirror. The masque has dried, 
giving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been 
wrapped in plastic. He begins slowly peeling the gel masque 
off his face.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some 
kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an 
entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold 
gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you 
and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably 
comparable: I simply am not there.

INT. BATEMAN BEDROOM - MORNING 

Another huge white room, equally minimal: a futon, rumpled 
white sheets, a bedside lamp with a halogen bulb, and a large 
expensive painting (Eric Fischl or David Salle) chosen by 
Bateman's interior decorator.

Dressed in silk boxer shorts, Bateman stands in front of a 
huge walk-in closet, filled with rows of expensive shirts, 
shoes and designer suits, organized according to color and 
tone.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
It is hard for me to make sense on any given 
level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality 
is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is 
persistent.

Fully dressed in Armani, Bateman stands in front of a 
full-length mirror in the middle of his vast bedroom, 
adjusting his cuff-links.

BATEMAN (V.0.) 
My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared 
a long time ago, if they ever did exist.

He gives a last look at the mirror and likes what he sees. 
He gives his reflection a smile.

INT. OFFICES OF PIERCE & PIERCE - DAY 

As Bateman walks down the corridor, he passes another MAN who 
looks just like him.

MAN 
Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.

Bateman walks past the desk of JEAN, his secretary, pulling 
his Walkman from around his neck. Jean is attractive, 
wholesome, earnest. She smiles shyly. She loves him.

JEAN 
Late?

BATEMAN 
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?

JEAN 
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what 
he was canceling or why.

BATEMAN 
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. 
Anyone else?

JEAN 
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.

BATEMAN 
When?

JEAN 
After six.

BATEMAN 
Negative. Cancel it.

Jean follows him into his office.

JEAN 
Oh? And what should I say?

BATEMAN
Just...say...no.

JEAN 
Just say no?

Jean stands at his desk, waiting for instructions.

BATEMAN 
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols 
at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All 
right?

JEAN 
(Playfully) 
Yes, sir.

She turns to leave.

BATEMAN 
Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight 
tonight.

Jean turns around.

JEAN 
Oh, something. . romantic?

BATEMAN 
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.

JEAN 
I'll do it.

BATEMAN 
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?

JEAN 
You look nice today.

Jean exits. Bateman straightens some magazines in his 
office, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a 
slightly different angle. He fiddles with some pencils in a 
beer stein. He puts on some MUSIC and flips through a 
Sports Illustrated. He buzzes Jean. She comes in a moment 
later with the Perrier and a file.

JEAN 
Yes?

BATEMAN 
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that 
outfit again.

JEAN 
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.

BATEMAN 
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a 
dress. A skirt or something.

Jean stands there, then looks down at herself.

JEAN 
(Smiling bravely) 
You don't like this, I take it?

BATEMAN 
Come on, you're prettier than that.

JEAN 
(Sarcastically) 
Thanks, Patrick.

The phone RINGS and Jean turns to leave.

BATEMAN 
I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels.

As Jean leaves, Bateman clicks on the TV set in one corner 
of the room and starts watching Jeopardy!

INT. TAXI - EVENING 

EVELYN WILLIAMS, Patrick Bateman's 
fiancée, is making notes with a gold Cross pen and sipping 
a bottle of mineral water. Evelyn is blonde, classically 
beautiful, expensively educated, and utterly pleased with 
herself. She usually addresses Patrick as if he were a 
small child.

EVELYN 
I'd want a zydeco band, Patrick. That's what I'd 
want, a zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something 
ethnic to shock Daddy Oh, I can't decide...And lots 
of chocolate truffles. Godiva. And oysters on the halfshell.

CLOSE-UP on Bateman, who is wearing a Walkman and staring 
out the window.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I'm trying to listen to the new George 
Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fiancée-keeps buzzing 
in my ear.

Evelyn continues to make notes.

EVELYN 
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. 
Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. 
And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.

BATEMAN 
(Removing his Walkman) 
Do...what.

EVELYN 
Get married. Have a wedding.

BATEMAN 
Evelyn?

EVELYN 
Yes, darling?

BATEMAN 
Is your Evian spiked?

EVELYN 
We should do it.

BATEMAN 
No-I can't take the time off work.

EVELYN 
Your father practically owns the company. You can do 
anything you like, silly.

BATEMAN 
I don't want to talk about it.

EVELYN 
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just 
quit? You don't have to work.

BATEMAN 
Because I...want...to...fit...in.

The taxi bumps to a halt.

INT. ESPACE RESTAURANT- NIGHT 

A cavernous garage, harshly spot-lit, decorated in 
self-conscious brutalist chic. Iron girders, walls of waxed 
plaster featuring exposed rusted pipes, a huge Schnabel 
smashed-plate painting on one wall. The tables and chairs are 
made of extremely uncomfortable 
bolted steel.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace 
since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do, 
and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.

Tm Price and two downtown types, STASH and VANDEN, are 
already seated. Vanden is about twenty, pretty and sullen, 
with green streaks in her black hair. Stash is pale, with 
ragged black hair and bad skin.

They are all trying to read large stainless steel menus 
that look like minimalist art.

PRICE 
The menu's in braille.

He gets up to greet them, giving Evelyn a suspiciously long 
kiss.

PRICE 
I have to talk to you.

He drags her away, half giggling and protesting.

EVELYN 
(Over her shoulder) 
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden 
and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.

BATEMAN 
(After smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and 
checking his hair) 
Hi. Pat Bateman.

Vanden takes his hand reluctantly, says nothing.

BATEMAN 
Let me guess-you live in the East Village?

Pause.

STASH 
SoHo.

COURTNEY RAWLINSON and LUIS CARRUTHERS arrive at the table. 
Courtney is blonde, classically beautiful and from 
precisely the same social background as Evelyn, but she is 
considerably more fragile and neurotic. Luis is 
half-English, half-Argentinean, slightly overweight (a 
rarity in this crowd), puppyish and eager to please. He 
wears the same type of designer clothes as Price and 
Bateman, but with foppish tendencies: velvet jackets, 
bow-ties, boldly patterned vests.

They exchange air kisses. As soon as Luis turns his back, 
Bateman sneaks a kiss on Courtney's neck.

COURTNEY 
(Whispering) 
Stop it!

Stash and Vanden watch them in silence.

LATER:

Price is whispering in Evelyn's ear. Everyone else is 
quietly eating, except Bateman, who is drinking and watching 
Evelyn and Price.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn 
are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting
person I know. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s 
usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight 
I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than her drug use, 
though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers, 
the biggest dufus in the business.

Courtney rouses herself from her drug haze.

COURTNEY
Tell me. Stash...do you think SoHo is 
becoming to...commercial?

CARRUTHERS 
Yes, I read that.

PRICE 
Oh, who gives a rat's ass?

VANDEN 
Hey. That affects us.

PRICE 
(Wired on coke) 
Oh ho ho. That affects us? What 
about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn't that 
affect us, too? I mean don't you know anything about Sri 
Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of 
Israelis there? Doesn't that affect us?

BATEMAN 
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important 
problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign 
policy is important, but there are more pressing problems 
at hand.

PRICE 
Like what?

BATEMAN 
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow 
down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world 
hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We 
have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We 
have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and 
oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while 
also promoting equal rights for women but change the 
abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still 
somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.

The table stares at Bateman uncomfortably.

BATEMAN 
We also have to control the influx of illegal 
immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional 
moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in 
movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have 
to promote general social concern and less materialism in 
young people.

Price chokes on his drink. Everyone is silent and 
mystified.

CARRUTHERS 
Patrick, how thought-provoking.

INT. EVELYN'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME EVENING 

Bateman and Evelyn are lying on her bed watching television.

BATEMAN 
Why don t you just go for Price?

EVELYN 
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?

BATEMAN 
He's rich.

EVELYN 
Everybody's rich.

BATEMAN 
He's good-looking.

EVELYN 
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.

BATEMAN 
He has a great body

EVELYN 
Everybody has a great body now.

Bateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get 
Evelyn to have sex with him. She ignores him, watching the 
Home Shopping Channel with the remote in her hand. Finally, 
he straddles her, penis close to her face. She tries to 
look around him at the TV, then takes notice.

EVELYN 
What do you want to do with that, floss with it?

Bateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television.

EVELYN 
Are you using minoxidil?

BATEMAN 
No. I'm not. Why should I ?

EVELYN 
Your hairline looks like it's receding.

BATEMAN 
It's not.

EXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT 

It is 3 a.m. Bateman is standing at an ATM, listening to the 
comforting sound of fresh bills thudding out of the machine. 
Bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk 
past him. He collects his money, placing it carefully in his 
wallet, and then walks toward her, whistling. He catches up 
to her as she pauses at a red light.

BATEMAN 
Hello.

The woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing 
his smile, smiles back.

INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY 

Bateman, dressed in an Armani suit 
with an unlit cigar between his teeth is standing in a dry 
cleaners, arguing with the Chinese woman behind the 
counter.

BATEMAN 
Listen, wait. You're not...shhh wait...
you're not giving me valid reasons.

The woman continues to speak to him in another language, 
grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket.

BATEMAN 
What are you trying to say to me?

Her husband has taken Bateman's horribly bloodstained 
sheets out of the bag and is staring at them.

BATEMAN 
Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee? 
Bleach-ee. Oh my God.

She keeps pointing to the jacket and talking.

BATEMAN 
(Talking over her) 
Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question. 
Two.
(Louder) 
Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very 
expensive sheets and I really need them clean.

She keeps talking and Bateman leans into her.

BATEMAN 
If you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill 
you, are you understanding me?

She talks faster.

BATEMAN 
Now listen-I have a very important lunch meeting 
(Checks Rolex) 
at Hubert's in thirty minutes, and I need those 
...no wait, twenty minutes. I have a lunch meeting at 
Hubert's in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and I need 
those sheets cleaned by this afternoon.

She keeps talking.

BATEMAN Listen. I cannot understand you.

Bateman starts laughing, slaps his hand down on the 
counter.

BATEMAN 
This is crazy. You're a fool. I can't cope with 
this.

Bateman is on the verge of tears.

BATEMAN 
Stupid bitchee! Understand? Oh Christ!

Someone enters the store behind him. It's VICTORIA, 
late-twenties, attractive but a little overweight, wearing a 
tailored business suit with white sneakers and sports socks.

VICTORIA 
Patrick?

She takes off her sunglasses.

VICTORIA 
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.

BATEMAN 
Hello 
(Mumbles un incomprehensible name)

Awkward pause.

BATEMAN 
Well.

VICTORIA 
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, 
but you
know. They really are the best.

BATEMAN 
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk 
to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.

Victoria moves toward the sheet that the old man is holding 
up. She
touches it and the woman behind the counter begins talking 
again.

VICTORIA 
Oh my, I see. What are those? Oh my.
BATEMAN 
Um, well...it s cranberry juice. Cranapple.

VICTORiA 
(Skeptically) Really?

BATEMAN 
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You 
know, like...
like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?

VICTORIA 
(As if sharing a secret joke) Oh yeah. Oh I get it. 
Fun with chocolate.

BATEMAN 
Listen, if you could talk to them 
(He yanks the sheet out of the man's hand) 
I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a 
lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.

Bateman turns to leave.

VICTORIA 
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?

BATEMAN 
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank 
you, uh...
Victoria?

VICTORIA 
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You 
know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.

BATEMAN 
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the 
time.

VICTORIA 
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?

BATEMAN 
(Checking his watch) 
Next Saturday?

VICTORIA 
(Shrugging) 
Yeah.

BATEMAN 
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. 
Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call 
you.

VICTORIA 
Okay. Do.

Bateman glares at the woman behind the counter and rushes 
out the door. Victoria stares after him as we hear the sound 
of the bell on the closing door.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Bateman is sitting on the sofa watching a video, talking to 
Courtney on a portable phone. He's holding a video box in one 
hand, perusing the title: Inside Lydia's Ass. Offscreen we hear 
the sounds of the porn movie as he talks.

BATEMAN 
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

COURTNEY 
What? Oh, I'm...busy.

BATEMAN 
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, 
and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to 
tonight?

COURTNEY 
Stop it. I'm...

BATEMAN 
On a lot of lithium?

COURTNEY 
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call 
tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.

BATEMAN 
You should come have dinner with me.
COURTNEY 
But-when?

BATEMAN 
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?

COURTNEY 
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I 
need to be
home for that.

BATEMAN 
Pumpkin?

COURTNEY 
Yes?

BATEMAN 
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.

COURTNEY 
Uh huh.

BATEMAN 
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New 
York.

COURTNEY 
I know. Stop it.

BATEMAN 
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling 
dickweed.

COURTNEY 
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.

BATEMAN 
Courtney? Dinner?

COURTNEY 
I can't.

BATEMAN 
I'm thinking Dorsia.

COURTNEY 
Dorsia's nice.

BATEMAN 
Nice?

COURTNEY 
You like it there, don't you?

BATEMAN 
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will 
you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a 
boyfriend to eat there tonight.

COURTNEY 
Okay. Yeah. What time?

BATEMAN 
Eight? 

COURTNEY 
Pick me up? 

BATEMAN 
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear 
something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?

Bateman hangs up, opens up the Zagat's guide and dials the 
number for Dorsia with trembling fingers. It's busy and so 
he puts it on speakerphone, constant redial. He waits with 
his head in his hands, sweating with anxiety, until there 
is finally an answer.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia. Please hold.

He is on hold for a long time, getting very tense.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia.

BATEMAN 
(Both of his eyes are closed) 
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to 
reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?

Long pause. The Maitre D' starts giggling quietly and then 
more loudly until the laughter is almost hysterical and he 
hangs up the phone.

INT. TAXI- NIGHT

Bateman and Courtney are in the back of a cab. Courtney is
heavily medicated.

COURTNEY 
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really 
relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this 
silver muffin dish. 
(She starts to pass out)

BATEMAN 
Is that Donald Trump's car?

COURTNEY 
(Thickly) 
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.

BATEMAN 
You know, Courtney, you should take some more 
lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you 
out of this slump.

COURTNEY 
I just want to have a child. Just...two...
perfect...children...
(Her voice trails as she descends back into a drug haze)

The cab draws up outside a restaurant. The awning reads 
"Barcadia."

INT. BARCADIA - NIGHT 

An insanely expensive nouvelle Italian restaurant all 
polished natural brick, spotless white tablecloths, 
minimalist flower arrangements, discreet lighting.

A waiter has come to take their drink orders.

BATEMAN
J&B. Straight.

COURTNEY 
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with 
a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman 
leans over and pulls her back up.

COURTNEY 
Are we here?

BATEMAN 
Yes.

COURTNEY 
This is Dorsia?

BATEMAN 
(Examining a menu that says "Barcadia" in large script) 
Yes, dear.

Courtney almost falls asleep while looking at her menu, and 
starts to slide off of her chair. Bateman grabs her by both 
shoulders and props her up.

BATEMAN 
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter 
soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine 
called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll 
love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and 
pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely. 

COURTNEY 
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick. 

She falls asleep at the table.

INT. COURTNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Bateman and Courtney are in Courtney's bed. Bateman is on 
top of her, reaching for a condom in the ashtray. He tears 
it open with his teeth, puts it on.

COURTNEY 
(Dazed on lithium) 
I want you to fuck me.

Bateman gets on top of her, starts to fuck her.

COURTNEY 
Luis is a despicable twit.

BATEMAN 
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.

He keeps fucking her.

COURTNEY 
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" 
Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? 
Get off me.

BATEMAN 
Is it a what?

COURTNEY 
Pull out.

BATEMAN 
I'm ignoring you.

COURTNEY 
(screaming) 
Pull out, goddamnit!

BATEMAN 
(Slowing down but not stopping)
What do you want, Courtney?

She pushes him away from her.

BATEMAN 
It's a plain end. I think.

COURTNEY 
Turn the light on.

She tries to sit up.

BATEMAN 
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.

COURTNEY 
Patrick. Turn on the Light.
He turns on the light. 

BATEMAN 
It's a plain end, see? So? 

COURTNEY 
Take it off. 

BATEMAN 
Why? 

COURTNEY 
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip – 
(She covers herself with her comforter) 
to catch the force of the ejaculate! 
BATEMAN 
I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?

Courtney throws a pillow over her head and starts crying. 

COURTNEY 
(Screaming) 
Do you think you're turning me on by having unsafe sex?

Bateman pulls the pillow off her and slaps her face.

BATEMAN 
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, 
Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us. 
(He slaps her again lightly) 
Why is it pulled down half an inch? 
So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!

COURTNEY 
(Choking crying) 
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. 
I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.

Bateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom.

BATEMAN 
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?

COURTNEY 
Oh God, just get it over with.

He fucks her quickly until he has a mediocre orgasm and 
falls down next to her. They lie side by side with their 
bodies not touching, eyes open, staring at the 
ceiling.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, PIERCE & PIERCE - DAY

Bateman and Luis Carruthers are seated at a long table in 
the conference room at Pierce & Pierce, which looks out onto 
a spectacular view of Manhattan.

CARRUTHERS 
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney.
Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a 
reservation there?

BATEMAN 
Lucky, I guess.

CARRUTHERS 
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, 
Valentino Couture?

BATEMAN 
Uh huh.

CARRUTHERS 
(Reaching out to touch it) 
It looks so soft.

BATEMAN 
(Catching Luis hand) 
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.

Carruthers is distracted by a question from the colleague 
on his left.Paul Owen enters, carrying the Wall St. Journal 
under his arm. He is handsome, supremely confident and 
self-satisfied; he sees himself as a leader among men.

OWEN 
(To Bateman) 
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?

BATEMAN 
I've been great. And you?

Their conversation fades down as we hear Bateman's 
thoughts.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam. 
It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P and in 
fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a 
penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses. 
Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have 
a slightly better haircut.

During this voiceover the CAMERA WANDERS over to MARCUS 
HALBERSTAM, who is conferring with a colleague in the 
opposite corner of the room. He bears a 
superficial resemblance to Bateman.

OWEN 
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?

BATEMAN 
(Nervous) 
It's...it's...all right.

OWEN 
Really? That's interesting. 
(He stares at Bateman, smiling)
Not great?

BATEMAN 
Oh well, you know.

OWEN 
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.

BATEMAN 
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.

McDermott and Price enter.

McDERMOTT 
Hey. Owen! Congratulations on the Fisher account.

OWEN 
Thank you, Baxter.

PRICE 
Listen, Paul. Squash?

OWEN 
Call me. 
(Hands him a business card)

PRICE 
How about Friday?

OWEN 
No can do. Got a res at eight-thirty at Dorsia. Great sea 
urchin ceviche. There is a stunned silence as he walks away 
and sits in a corner of the room, ostentatiously studying papers.

CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face, cold with hatred.

PRICE
(Whispering) 
Jesus. Dorsia? On a Friday night? How'd he swing that?

McDERMOTT (Whispering) 
I think he's lying.

Bateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card. 

PRICE 
(Suddenly enthused) 
What's that, a gram? 

BATEMAN 
New card. What do you think?

McDermott lifts it up and examines the lettering carefully. 

McDERMOTT 
Whoa. Very nice. Take a look.

He hands it to Van Patten.

BATEMAN 
Picked them up from the printers yesterday

VAN PATTEN 
Good coloring.

BATEMAN 
That's bone. And the lettering is something called 
Silian Rail.

McDERMOTT 
(Envious) 
Silian Rail?

VAN PATTEN 
It is very cool, Bateman. But that's nothing.

He pulls a card out of his wallet and slaps it on the 
table. 

VAN PATTEN 
Look at this.

They all lean forward to inspect it. 

PRICE 
That's really nice.

Bateman clenches his fists beneath the table, trying to 
control his anxiety.

VAN PATTEN 
Eggshell with Romalian type. 
(Turning to Bateman)
What do you think?

BATEMAN 
(Barely able to breath, his voice a croak) 
Nice.

PRICE 
(Holding the card up to the light) 
Jesus. This is really super. How'd a nitwit like you get so 
tasteful?

Bateman stares at his own card and then enviously at 
McDermott's. 

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.

PRICE 
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet. 

He holds up his own card. 

PRICE 
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...

BATEMAN 
(Choking with anxiety) 
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.

Price pulls a card from an inside coat pocket and holds it 
up for their inspection: "PAUL OWEN, PIERCE & PIERCE, 
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS." Bateman swallows, speechless. 
The sound in the room dies down and all we hear is a faint 
heartbeat as Bateman stares at the magnificent card.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness 
of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark...

His hand shaking, Bateman lifts up the card and stares at it 
until it fills the screen.

He lets it fall. The SOUND RETURNS TO NORMAL.

CARRUTHERS Is something wrong? Patrick...you're sweating.

EXT. STREET- EVENING 

The financial district. The streets are eerily deserted.

Bateman stands at an ATM, enjoying the reassuring sound of 
$500 in fresh bills thudding from the machine. As he turns 
to leave, he notices someone across the street.

A HOMELESS MAN is lying in a doorway on top of an open 
grate, surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart. A 
cardboard sign is attached to the front of the cart: I AM 
HOMELESS AND HUNGRY PLEASE HELP ME. A small, thin dog lies 
next to him.

He is black, dressed in a stained, torn, lime-green 
polyester pants suit with jeans worn over the pants.

BATEMAN 
(Offering his hand) Hello. Pat Bateman.

The Homeless Man stares at Bateman, struggling to sit up.

BATEMAN 
You want some money?. Some...food?

The Homeless Man nods and starts to cry. Bateman reaches 
into his pocket and pulls out a $I 0 bill, then changes his 
mind and holds out a $5 instead.

BATEMAN 
Is this what you need?

The Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose.

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm so hungry.

BATEMAN 
It's cold out, too, isn't it?

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm so hungry.

BATEMAN 
(Holding the bill just out of the man's reach) 
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you 
get a job?

HOMELESS MAN 
(Shivering and sobbing) 
I lost my job...

BATEMAN 
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? 
Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on 
the job?

HOMELESS MAN I was fired. I was laid off.

BATEMAN 
Gee, uh, that's too bad.

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm so hungry.

The dog starts to whimper.

BATEMAN 
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm not...

BATEMAN 
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm hungry

BATEMAN 
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. 
I'm trying to help you.

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm hungry.

BATEMAN 
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who 
do have jobs? From people who do work?

HOMELESS MAN 
What am I gonna do?

BATEMAN 
Listen, what's your name?

HOMELESS MAN
Al.

BATEMAN 
Speak up. Come on.

HOMELESS MAN
Al.

BATEMAN 
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. 
That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. 
I'll help you.

HOMELESS MAN 
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind
man. I can tell.

BATEMAN 
(Petting the dog) 
Shhhh...it's okay.

HOMELESS MAN 
(Grabbing Bateman's wrist) 
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.

BATEMAN 
(Stroking his face, whispering) 
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.

HOMELESS MAN 
I can't...I can't find a shelter

BATEMAN 
You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that? 
(Shouting)
Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of 
faggot. Al...I'm sorry.

Bateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet.

BATEMAN 
It's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common 
with you.

He opens his briefcase and pulls out a long thin knife with 
a serrated edge. He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to 
protect it.

BATEMAN 
Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are?

HOMELESS MAN'S POV as Bateman lunges at him with the knife.

EXTREME WIDE SHOT of the street. Bateman's shadowed figure
is hunched over the Homeless Man, stabbing him in the stomach.
The dog barks wildly and Bateman stomps on it until it is 
silent.

LOW ANGLE shot of Bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground.

BATEMAN
There's a quarter. Go buy some gum.

Bateman walks calmly into the empty caverns of Wall Street. 
Cars drift past, their headlights momentarily illuminating the 
body left twitching on the ground.

INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY 

CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face and torso. His eyes are closed as a 
woman's hands rub cream into his face.

FACIALIST 
What beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman. So 
fine, so smooth...

His eyes open to look up at the facialist and then he 
closes them again.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood, 
skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable emotion except 
for greed ,und disgust. Something horrible is happening inside 
me and I don't know why.

CUT TO:

Bateman sitting in a chair, looking down at the 
MANICURIST who is giving him a pedicure. She is cutting his 
nails with tiny sharp scissors. He stares at them longingly.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal, 
on the verge of frenzy.

CUT TO:

Bateman lying irradiated by ultraviolet light on a tanning 
bed, wearing goggles.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.

INT. TEXARKANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT 

An insanely expensive nouvelle Tex-Mex restaurant, with an 
ironic Southwestern decor: Santa Fe colors, Navajo blankets, 
naive cowboy art, rawhide banquettes.

Bateman bursts in the door, late, and approaches the MAITRE D'.

BATEMAN 
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?

MAITRE D'
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.

Paul Owen is seated at a table underneath an enormous pair of 
ram's horns. He is arguing with the WAITER.

OWEN 
No, I want to know. I came here for the cilantro 
crawfish gumbo, which is after all the only excuse one 
could have for being in this restaurant, which is by the 
way, almost completely empty. Am I to believe that all ten 
people in this restaurant have eaten your entire supply of 
cilantro crawfish gumbo?

WAITER 
I'm very sorry sir. There was a fire in the kitchen 
earlier today, and-

BATEMAN 
J&B, straight. And a Dixie beer.

WAITER 
Would you like to hear-

OWEN 
Double Absolut martini.

WAITER 
Yes, sir. Would you like to hear the specials?

BATEMAN 
Not if you want to keep your spleen.

The Waiter leaves.

OWEN 
This is a real beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam. 

This place is hot, very hot.

BATEMAN 
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous 
here.

OWEN 
Yeah, well, you're late.

BATEMAN 
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break 
(Studying the menu; he's in a surprisingly good mood) 
Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.

OWEN 
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.

BATEMAN 
Nobody goes there anymore.

There is a long disgruntled silence.

BATEMAN 
Is that Ivana Trump over there? (Laughs) Jeez 
Patrick I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana 
be at Texarkana?

Another pause.

BATEMAN 
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the 
Fisher account? How did you get it?

OWEN 
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have 
to kill you.

He guffaws. Bateman laughs politely.

LATER: 
Paul Owen is very drunk. BATEMAN cold sober.

BATEMAN 
I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?

Owen continues laughing and motions to the waiter for another 
drink.

OWEN 
Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive. Where do you tan?

BATEMAN Salon.

OWEN 
I've got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it.

Bateman nods, agitated.

OWEN 
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?

BATEMAN 
Cecelia is, well...you know (Cecelia. I think 
she's having dinner with...Evelyn Williams.

OWEN 
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick 
Bateman. What a dork.

BATEMAN 
Another Martini, Paul?

Owen nods drunkenly.

LATER:

The end of the meal. Owen is squeezing a lime onto the 
table, missing his beer, incredibly drunk. The check is laid 
down.

BATEMAN 
(Talking to Owen like a child) 
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy.
Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.

BATEMAN 
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave 
a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?

OWEN 
No, man. I'm gonna bail.

BATEMAN 
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch. 
(Helping him into his jacket) 
I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a 
bottle of Absolut waiting for us.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The living room floor has been meticulously covered with 
newspaper.

Owen is slumped drunkenly in a white Eames chair, a glass 
in his hand. Bateman is looking through his CDs.

BATEMAN 
You like Huey Lewis and the News?

OWEN 
They're okay.
BATEMAN 
Their early work was a little too New Wave for my 
taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really 
came into their own, commercially and artistically.

Bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the
shower. He takes two Valium.

BATEMAN 
(Said partly from the bathroom) 
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of 
consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost.
Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall. 
He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen 
from behind ail the time.

BATEMAN 
He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think 
Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor.

Owen is absent-mindedly leafing through the Barneys 
catalogue.

OWEN 
Hey, Halberstam?

BATEMAN 
Yes, Owen?

OWEN 
Why are there copies of the Style section all over 
the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?

BATEMAN 
No, Owen.

OWEN 
(Confused) 
Is that a raincoat?

BATEMAN 
Yes, it is.

Bateman moves to the CD player. He takes a CD out of its 
case and slides it in the machine.

BATEMAN 
In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most 
accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is 
"HiP To Be Square," a song so catchy that most people probably 
don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not 
just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of 
trends. It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself.

Bateman puts on "Hip To Be Square."

BATEMAN crosses the room and picks up the ax.

We follow BATEMAN from behind as he walks up to Owen, the 
ax raised over his head.

BATEMAN 
Hey, Paul?

As Owen turns around, FROM OWEN'S POV we see Bateman swing 
the ax toward his face.

Blood sprays onto the white raincoat.

FROM BEHIND OWEN, we see BATEMAN as he yanks the ax out.

Owen drops to the floor. His body falls out of the frame. 
We stay on his legs twitching mechanically.

Blood pulses onto the newspaper-covered floor.

BATEMAN 
(Raising the ax and screaming) 
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking 
stupid bastard!

LOW ANGLE ON BATEMAN as he beats Owen with the back of the 
ax.

OFFSCREEN, the sound of the ax hitting Owen.

BATEMAN 
(Panting) 
Fucking bastard...

Bateman takes his raincoat off, still panting. He folds the 
coat carefully in half, bloody side in, and drapes it neatly 
over the back of a chair.

He sits back on the white sofa and surveys the scene. He 
checks his Rolex and lights a cigar.

OFFSCREEN, Paul Owen's last faint sighs are heard.

INT. LOBBY - NIGHT 

BATEMAN drags a large, blood-soaked sleeping bag through the lobby, 
past the bored doorman, who looks up from the Post for a moment.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

BATEMAN is trying to hail a cab. Owen's body is at his 
feet. Luis Carruthers and a Japanese girl walk up to him.

CARRUTHERS 
Patrick? Is that you?

BATEMAN 
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.

CARRUTHERS 
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good 
friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to 
Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it. 
(Looking down at the body) 
Where did you get your overnight bag?

BATEMAN 
Commes des Garcon.

A cab stops. BATEMAN opens the door and manages to get 
Owen's body into the backseat.

Bateman gets into the cab.

CARRUTHERS 
Call me please, Patrick.

BATEMAN 
Jesus lives, Luis.

INT. BATEMAN'S HELL'S KITCHEN APARTMENT - NIGHT 

A bare room, lit by one light bulb. The walls are blank 
except for a Les Miserables poster. There is one ratty chair.

Bateman pours lime over Paul Owen's body, which is lying in 
a bathtub. He plays Huey Lewis, smokes a cigar, watches the 
body dissolve.

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Bateman is letting himself into the apartment. It is very 
similar to Bateman's, but even more minimalist. The walls 
are white-pigmented concrete with a large minimalist painting 
on the wall. One wall is covered in a trendy, large-scale 
scientific drawing above a long, black leather couch.

BATEMAN 
Where to send the bastard? Dallas? Pans?

He throws some clothes into a suitcase, randomly grabbing 
toiletries and shoving them in.

BATEMAN 
Singapore? London. I'll send the asshole to London.

He puts some music on to help muffle his voice, then leans 
over the answering machine.

He does a passable imitation of Owen's speech.

BATEMAN 
Hi, this is Paul. I've been called away to London 
for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back. 
Hasta la vista, baby.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - MORNING 

Bateman is sitting at his desk, with the latest copy of 
Sports Illustrated in front of him and his Walkman playing 
Kenny G. We hear the MUSIC until Jean enters and he takes 
the Walkman off.

BATEMAN 
(Faintly irritable) 
What is it?

JEAN 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
(Condescendingly) 
Ye-es, Je-an?

JEAN 
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.

BATEMAN 
Who?

JEAN 
Detective Donald KIMBALL?

Silence. Bateman stares out the window, then down at the 
drawing of a headless woman he's been doodling on the back 
cover of Sports Illustrated.

BATEMAN 
Tell him I'm at lunch.

JEAN 
(whispering) 
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. 
It's only ten-thirty. 

Silence. 

BATEMAN 
Send him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless 
phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end.

BATEMAN 
Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion 
to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good 
buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt 
calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties...

The door to the office opens and he waves in DETECTIVE DONALD 
KIMBALL. KIMBALL is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age - 
and good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of 
the type Bateman and his friends might wear.

Kimball sits down and crosses his legs with a 
self-assurance that makes Bateman so nervous he forgets to 
carry on with his fake conversation. Kimball looks up at 
him curiously, noticing the silence.

BATEMAN 
(Realizing that Kimball is staring at him) 
Right. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent.

Bateman shrugs at the detective, rolling his eyes in 
exasperation. 

KIMBALL nods understandingly.

BATEMAN 
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just 
walked in...
(He laughs inanely) 
Just joking...
(Pause) 
No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, 
right, got it. 
(He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in) 
Sorry about that.

KIMBALL 
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment. 
(Gesturing toward the phone) 
Was that anything important?

BATEMAN 
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. 
Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors...
Spreading gossip.

They laugh politely.

KIMBALL 
(Holding out his hand) 
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL

BATEMAN 
(Shaking firmly) 
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.

KIMBALL 
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed 
to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, 
you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.

KIMBALL stares at the three open copies of Sports 
Illustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk. 
Bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines 
into the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is 
still running.

BATEMAN 
(Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed) 
So, what's the topic of discussion?

KIMBALL 
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate 
the disappearance of Paul Owen.

BATEMAN 
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?

KIMBALL 
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.

BATEMAN 
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.

KIMBALL 
So it's nothing that official. I just have some 
basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-

BATEMAN 
Coffee?

KIMBALL 
No. I'm okay.

BATEMAN 
Perrier? San Pellegrino?

KIMBALL 
No, I'm okay.

KIMBALL takes out a small black notepad and the same gold 
Cross pen that Bateman and his friends all use. Bateman buzzes 
Jean.

JEAN (O.S.) 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Can you bring Mr...

KIMBALL 
KIMBALL.

BATEMAN 
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-

KIMBALL 
Oh no, I'm okay.

BATEMAN 
It's no problem

Bateman watches intently as KIMBALL writes something down 
in his notebook, then crosses something out. Jean enters 
and places the bottle of San Pellegrino and a Steuben etched 
glass on the table, shooting a concerned glance at Bateman. 
He glares at her. KIMBALL smiles and nods at Jean as she leaves.

BATEMAN 
Well, what's the topic of discussion?

KIMBALL 
The disappearance of Paul Owen.

BATEMAN 
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the 
disappearance or anything...
(Trying to laugh) 
Not on "Page Six" at least.

KIMBALL 
I think his family wants this kept quiet.

BATEMAN 
Understandable. 
(Staring at the untouched bottle of San Pellegrino) 
Lime?

KIMBALL 
No, really. I'm okay.

BATEMAN 
You sure? I can always get you a lime.

A pause.

KIMBALL
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own 
files, okay?

BATEMAN 
Shoot.

KIMBALL 
How old are you?

BATEMAN 
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.

KIMBALL 
(Scribbling in his notebook) 
Where did you go to school?

BATEMAN 
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.

KIMBALL 
Your address?

BATEMAN 
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American
Gardens Building.

KIMBALL 
(Looking up, impressed) 
Nice. Very nice.

BATEMAN 
(Flattered) 
Thanks.

A pause as KIMBALL studies his notebook. Bateman closes his
eyes, as if in pain.

KIMBALL 
Pardon me, but are you okay?

BATEMAN 
Who do you ask?

KIMBALL
You seem...nervous.

Bateman reaches into his desk drawer and brings out a 
bottle of aspirin.

BATEMAN 
Nuprin?

KIMBALL Uh...no, thanks.

Kimball takes out a pack of Marlboro's and lays it on the 
desk.

BATEMAN 
Bad habit.

KIMBALL 
I know. I'm sorry.

A pause, as Bateman stares at the cigarettes.

KIMBALL 
Would you rather I not smoke?

BATEMAN 
No, I guess it's okay.

KIMBALL 
You sure?

BATEMAN 
No problem. 
(Buzzing Jean)

JEAN (O.S.) 
Yes, Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please.
She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.

KIMBALL 
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?

BATEMAN 
Well...

He coughs, shakes two Nuprin into his hand and swallows 
them dry.

KIMBALL 
How well did you know him?

BATEMAN 
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, 
you know.

KIMBALL 
Yale thing?

A pause.

BATEMAN 
Yeah...Yale thing.

KIMBALL 
What do you mean...Yale thing?

A pause.

BATEMAN 
Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet 
homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing.

A silence during which the sound of the air conditioner 
becomes deafening.

KIMBALL 
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul 
Owen?

BATEMAN 
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He...
ate a balanced diet.

KIMBALL 
What kind of man was he? Besides...
(He hesitates tries to smile) 
the information you've just given.

BATEMAN 
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.

KIMBALL 
Do you feel that way?

BATEMAN 
No. Not really.

KIMBALL 
(As he writes without looking up) 
Where did Paul hang out?

BATEMAN 
Hang...out?

KIMBALL 
Yeah. You know...hang out.

BATEMAN 
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine.
Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular 
places.

KIMBALL 
He had a yacht?

BATEMAN 
No, he just hung out there.

KIMBALL 
And where did he go to school?

A slight pause.

BATEMAN 
Don't you know this?

KIMBALL 
I just wanted to know if you know.
BATEMAN 
Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's...
Listen, I just...I just want to help.

KIMBALL 
I understand.

He makes another note.

KIMBALL 
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?

BATEMAN 
We were both seven in 1969.

KIMBALL 
(Smiles) 
So was I.

BATEMAN 
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?

KIMBALL 
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he 
went to London.

BATEMAN 
Well, maybe he did, huh?

KIMBALL 
His girlfriend doesn't think so.

BATEMAN 
But...has anyone seen him in London?

KIMBALL 
Actually, yes.

BATEMAN 
Hmmm.

KIMBALL 
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. 
A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but 
I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert 
Ainsworth for Paul, so...

BATEMAN 
Oh.

KIMBALL 
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan
worship?

BATEMAN 
What?

KIMBALL 
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I 
know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't 
know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was 
recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano 
girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-

BATEMAN 
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced 
diet and-

KIMBALL 
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.

A pause - the longest so far.

BATEMAN 
Have you consulted a psychic?

KIMBALL 
No.

BATEMAN 
Had his apartment been burglarized?

KIMBALL 
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A 
suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.

BATEMAN 
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet 
or anything, right?

KIMBALL 
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But...
basically no one has seen or heard anything.

BATEMAN 
That's so typical, isn't it?

KIMBALL 
It's just strange. 
(He stares out the window, lost in thought) 
One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, 
and then...

BATEMAN 
Nothing.

KIMBALL 
People just...disappear.

BATEMAN 
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
(He checks his Rolex)

KIMBALL 
Eerie. Really eerie.

Silence.

BATEMAN 
(Standing up) 
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting 
with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.

KIMBALL 
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I 
mean aren't you going to be late?

BATEMAN 
Uh, no. There's one...down here.

KIMBALL 
Oh really? I didn't know that.

Bateman leads him to the door.

BATEMAN 
Yes. It's very good.

KIMBALL turns to face him.

KIMBALL 
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information 
at all...

BATEMAN 
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.

KIMBALL 
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.

Bateman closes the door firmly on KIMBALL. He closes his 
eyes and leans against the door, sweating.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 

A perfectly lit kitchen still-life - a bottle of Evian, 
a white porcelain plate on which sits a sliced kiwi, some perfect 
green grapes, a few berries.

OFFSCREEN, the SOUND OF SCREAMS AND A CHAINSAW can be heard 
from the living room.

The living room: Bateman is maniacally doing abdominal 
crunches as the television plays a video of Texas Chainsaw 
Massacre. There is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table, 
next to a copy of GQ.

LATER:

Bateman is sitting in his armchair, phone book in hand, 
jerking off. He is squealing into the phone and breathing.

BATEMAN 
You like that, slut?

The person on the other end clearly hangs up.

CLOSE-UP on his fingers dialing the phone.

BATEMAN 
You want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar 
boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white 
cotton T-shirt by 
Commes des Garcons. 
(He snorts like a pig) 
My Rolex cost-

Another hang-up. He dials again.

BATEMAN 
(Whipering) 
I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do 
you think of that? 
(Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts) 
Huh, bitch?

GIRL (O.S.)
Dad, is that you?

Bateman hangs up, frustrated.

EXT. STREET/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 

Bateman cruises around in the limo. It pulls up alongside 
CHRISTIE, a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket. 
Bateman opens his window to speak to her.

BATEMAN 
I haven't seen you around here.

CHRISTIE 
You just haven't been looking.

BATEMAN 
Would you like to see my apartment?

Bateman flips on the light inside the limo. He's wearing a 
tuxedo.

CHRISTIE 
(looking away to some dark corner) 
I'm not supposed to.

Bateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now 
notices, then takes.

BATEMAN 
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?

CHRISTIE 
I'm not supposed to. 
(She pockets the bill) 
But I can make an exception.

BATEMAN 
Do you take American Express?

Christie is still looking out behind her.

BATEMAN 
Do you take American Express?

Christie looks at him like he's crazy.

BATEMAN 
I'm joking. Come on, get in.

As they drive uptown, Bateman dials the cell-phone. He 
reads off a credit card number.

BATEMAN 
I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does 
couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the 
American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really 
can't stress blonde enough. Blonde.

He hangs up.

BATEMAN I'm Paul. My name is Paul 0wen, have you'got that? 
You are Christie. You are to respond only to Christie. Is 
that clear?

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Christie is in the bathtub, Bateman is pouring in white 
milky bath oil.

BATEMAN 
That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking.

Long pause, in which Christie is luxuriating in the tub and 
Bateman is casually touching her breast.

BATEMAN 
I want you to clean your vagina.

Christie reaches for a washcloth.

BATEMAN 
No. From behind. Get on your knees.

Christie shrugs.

BATEMAN 
I want to watch. You have a very nice body.

The doorman RINGS. Bateman answers.

BATEMAN 
Thank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry 
off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and 
our guest in the living room for drinks.

Bateman answers the door.

BATEMAN 
You've arrived! How lovely, let me take your coat. 
I'm Paul. How good of you to come.

The escort girl looks somewhat bewildered. Bateman takes 
her coat and inspects her body and face.

BATEMAN 
Not quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I'm 
going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Owen.

Bateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a 
glass of wine. Christie enters, sitting next to Sabrina on the 
couch, and Bateman sits across from them. There is a 
long silence.

BATEMAN 
So, don't you want to know what I do?

The two girls look at each other with uncomfortable smiles. 
Christie shrugs.

CHRISTIE 
No.

SABRINA 
(Smiling) 
No, not really.

Bateman is visibly irritated, recrosses his legs.

BATEMAN 
Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce & Pierce. 
(Long pause) 
Have you heard of it?

Another long pause. They shake their heads. Christie stands 
up and goes over to the CD collection.

CHRISTIE 
You have a really nice place here...Paul. 
How much did you pay for it?

BATEMAN 
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, 
hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.

Bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and Sabrina takes a 
pack of cigarettes out of her purse.
Bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates.

BATEMAN 
No, no smoking. Not in here.

He walks over to Christie.

BATEMAN 
Varda truffle?

Christie stares at the plate and shakes her head. Sabrina 
takes one.

BATEMAN 
I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very 
fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.

Bateman goes over to his CDs and scans his vast collection. 
He takes one out and examines it.

BATEMAN 
Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis 
fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before 
that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too 
artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' 
presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out 
another one.

BATEMAN 
I think "Invisible Touch" is the group's undisputed
masterpiece.

He puts on the song and gestures for them to follow him 
into the bedroom.

BATEMAN 
It's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the 
same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding 
three albums. Christie, take off the robe.

Bateman puts out a lace teddy. He motions to Christie to 
put it on.

BATEMAN 
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, 
Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance 
of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress.

Bateman starts to undress.

BATEMAN 
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer 
songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. 
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?

Sabrina dances awkwardly. Christie sits on the bed.

BATEMAN 
Take the lyrics to "Land of Confusion." In this 
song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political 
authority.

Bateman knots a silk scarf around Christie's neck - rather 
menacingly - then helps her into some suede gloves. 

BATEMAN 
"In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about 
monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. 
Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything 
I've heard in rock.

He turns on the video camera. 

BATEMAN 
Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your 
asshole.

Bateman looks through the viewfinder.

BATEMAN 
Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and 
therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially 
songs like "In the Air Tonight" and "Against 
All Odds." Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it. 

He walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in 
the CD.

BATEMAN 
But I also think that Phill Collins works better 
within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and 
I stress the word artist. This is "Sussudio," a great, 
great song, a personal favorite.

SEX MONTAGE CUT TO "Sussudio." We see this in WIDE SHOT, or 
through the LENS OF THE VIDEO CAMERA.

CUT TO: 

Bateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina 
on either side of him. Sabrina accidentally touches his 
wrist. Bateman's eyes open.

BATEMAN 
Don't touch the Rolex.

Bateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire.

He opens the drawer in which are a nail gun, a coat hanger, 
a rusty butter knife and a half-smoked cigar. He turns 
around to see Christie and Sabrina both starting to get up 
and get dressed. He takes the coat hanger.

BATEMAN 
We're not through yet...

CUT TO:

Bateman ushering them out the door impatiently. They 
are both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding. Bateman has a 
deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder. In the 
b.g. Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight" is playing.

INT. YALE CLUB – DAY
 
McDermott, Van Patten and Bateman are 
having drinks. Price walks by with a gorgeous girl and 
gives them the finger.

BATEMAN 
What an asshole.

McDERMOTT 
Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price? He's a 
fucking drug addict. No self-control.

VAN PATTEN 
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do 
you think, Bateman?

BATEMAN 
I know her. I knew her.

McDERMOTT 
Why do you say it like that? Why does he say it 
like that?

VAN PATTEN 
Because he dated her.

BATEMAN 
How did you guess?

VAN PATTEN 
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, 
Bateman.

BATEMAN 
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy 
personality.

McDERMOTT 
So what? It's all looks. Laurie Kennedy is a 
babe. Don't even pretend you were interested for any other 
reason.

VAN PATTEN 
If they have a good personality, then something 
is very wrong.

McDERMOTT 
If they have a good personality and they are not 
great looking-who fucking cares?

BATEMAN 
Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if 
they have a good personality? 
(He smiles giving up) 
I know, I know-

ALL IN UNISON
There are no girls with good personalities! 
(They laugh and high-five each other)

VAN PATTEN 
A good personality consists of a chick with a 
little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without 
being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep 
her dumb fucking mouth 
shut.

McDERMOTT 
Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are
smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even 
talented-though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly 
chicks.

VAN PATTEN 
Absolutely.

McDERMOTT 
And this is because they have to make up for how 
fucking unattractive they are.

Pause.

BATEMAN 
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?

VAN PATTEN 
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?

BATEMAN 
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was 
an interesting guy.

McDERMOTT 
So what did Ed say?

BATEMAN 
He said, "When I see a pretty girl walking down the 
street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her 
out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat 
her right."

Pauses, finishes his drink.

McDERMOTT 
What does the other part of him think?

BATEMAN 
What her head would look like on a stick.

McDermott and Van Patten look at each other and then back 
at Bateman. Bateman starts to laugh, and the other two uneasily
join In.

Luis Carruthers walks up to the table.

CARRUTHERS 
(Shyly) 
Hi, guys. I wanna get your opinion on something.

McDermott rolls his eyes at the rest of the table.

McDERMOTT If it's about the bow-tie you're wearing, you 
know how we feel about it. Luis laughs good-naturedly.

CARRUTHERS 
Yes, I do. No, it's my business card-I decided to 
get a new one too.

He pulls out something incredibly tasteful. Everyone 
compliments Luis except Bateman. The SOUND DROPS and all we hear 
is the beating of his heart as he stares at the card enviously. 
Luis plucks it from his hand and walks away, pleased with 
himself.

VAN PATTEN 
Listen, what about dinner?

BATEMAN 
(Suddenly angry) 
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about 
fucking dinner?" 

McDERMOTT 
Ah, cheer up, Bateman. 
(Slaps him on the back, massages his neck) 
What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning? 

BATEMAN 
(Watching Luis going into the men's room) 
Keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump.

McDERMOTT 
Whoa, hold on there, little buddy.

BATEMAN 
Excuse me.

He gets up from the table. As Bateman walks away, Van 
Patten grabs a waiter.

VAN PATTEN 
Is this tap water? I don't drink tap water Bring 
me an Evian or something, okay?

INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY 

Bateman pulls on his gloves as he 
enters the men's room. Carruthers is standing in a stall with his 
back to Bateman. The sound of his urinating is heard until Bateman 
approaches, then abruptly stops. Slowly, Bateman brings his hands 
up over the collar of Carruthers' cashmere jacket, circling his 
neck until both thumbs and index fingers meet. All we can hear 
is the sound of Bateman's heavy breathing. Slowly he starts to 
squeeze. Almost in slow motion, Carruthers turns around.

Carruthers looks down at Bateman's wrists as if lost in 
thought. Then he lowers his head and kisses Bateman's 
wrist. He looks back at Bateman with a shy, love-struck 
expression, then reaches up and tenderly touches the side 
of his face.

CARRUTHERS 
God, Patrick. Why here?

He strokes Bateman's hair.

CARRUTHERS 
I've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your hot body.

Carruthers tries to kiss him on the lips but Bateman backs 
away. He drops his hands from Carruthers' neck. Carruthers 
immediately takes them and places them back. Bateman drops 
them again.

CARRUTHERS 
Don't be shy.

Bateman takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and tries to lift 
his hands again, but abandons the attempt.

CARRUTHERS 
You don't know how long I've wanted it. Ever since that Christmas 
party at Arizona 206. You know the one, you were wearing that 
red-striped paisley Armani tie.

Bateman looks down and sees that Carruthers' pants are 
still unzipped. He moves past him out of the stall and 
stands by the sink and pretends to wash his hands until he 
realizes he still has his gloves on. Carruthers comes up 
behind him.

CARRUTHERS 
I want you. I want you...too.

Bateman storms out of the men's room, bumping into a waiter 
and several customers and cursing. Noticing the maitre d' 
and another waiter conferring and looking at him strangely, 
Bateman straightens up and smiles and waves cheerfully at 
them. Carruthers walks up behind him.

BATEMAN 
(Hissing) 
What...is...it?

CARRUTHERS 
Where are you going?

BATEMAN 
(Stumbling away from him) 
I've gotta...I've 
gotta...return some videotapes.

CARRUTHERS 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
What?
CARRUTHERS 
(Silently mouthing the words) 
I'll call you.

Bateman storms out of the restaurant.

INT. COURTNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Bateman is lying on top of Courtney in her bed, after sex. 
Still panting, he rolls off her, onto his back. He feels 
something lumpy underneath him and pulls out a stuffed toy, 
a black cat with blue jewel eyes. There is silence.

COURTNEY 
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?

BATEMAN 
Maybe.

Courtney sighs and reaches for a bottle of pills on her 
nightstand, swallowing several. Bateman gets up and begins 
to dress, admiring himself in the mirror. Courtney watches 
the TV at low volume.

COURTNEY 
What are you doing tonight?

BATEMAN 
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.

COURTNEY 
That's nice.

BATEMAN 
You and...Luis?

COURTNEY 
(Lighting a cigarette) 
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and 
Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...

BATEMAN 
I never knew you smoked.

COURTNEY 
(Smiling sadly) 
You never noticed.

Bateman is making final adjustments to his tie.

COURTNEY 
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?

BATEMAN 
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're 
going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.

COURTNEY 
(Sarcastically) 
Isn't that special? 
(A pause) 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Yes, Courtney?

C0URTNEY 
If I don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a nice one, okay?

BATEMAN 
(Flatly) 
You too.

Courtney picks up the black cat and starts petting its 
head. Bateman heads down the hallway to the front door.

COURTNEY 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Yes?

COURTNEY 
Nothing.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 

A big eighties nightclub with a mixed crowd: hip-hop 
kids, visitors from Jersey, downtown art people, yuppies.

I Bateman makes his way through the crowd to the bar, and 
tries to attract the bartender's attention. He is wearing a 
suit and his tie is loosened. Kimball approaches him.

KIMBALL 
Mr. Bateman?

Bateman gasps and recovers.

BATEMAN 
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell?
KIMBALL 
Kimball. 
(Extending his hand) 
Call me Don.

BATEMAN 
Don.

KIMBALL 
So...you hang out here a lot?

BATEMAN 
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You 
know.

Pause.

BATEMAN 
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone 
in for "formal questioning?" (He makes quotation marks 
in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh)

KIMBALL 
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?

BATEMAN 
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.

KIMBALL 
(Looking at his glass) 
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much 
more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, 
don't you think?

Bateman is nodding nervously, idiotically.

KIMBALL 
Some people just can t help themselves. Another Stoli?

Bateman shakes his head.

KIMBALL 
I mean they want to get caught.

BATEMAN 
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need 
anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean 
Owen was a...complex man.

Bateman wanders away.

He looks back uneasily at KIMBALL, who is watching him from 
the bar. A GUY WITH DREADLOCKS walks by.

BATEMAN 
(Holding up his hand to high-five) Rasta Man!

The man stares at him.

BATEMAN 
I mean-Mon. We be jammin'...

The man walks by, shaking his head.

Bateman wanders into the next room, which is filled with a 
more familiar crowd: young men in designer suits, girls in 
black designer dresses. Across the room he spots McDermott 
and Price sitting with three models, all wearing black 
mini-dresses. Price and McDermott are having a whispered 
argument.

PRICE 
I have to talk to these girls? They're models.

McDERMOTT 
Someone has to get the Bolivian marching powder. 
You went last time. Stay here.

McDermott waves gaily to the girls and disappears.
Bateman looks at the models. DAISY and CARON are staring 
into space, smoking. LIBBY is trying to work out how to 
unfold her napkin. Price signals to Bateman for help.

PRICE 
(Clapping his hands together) 
Let's have a conversation. So...it was hot out today, no?

Silence.

LIBBY 
Where did Craig go?

PRICE 
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott is going to 
sign a peace treaty with him between the United States 
and Russia. McDermott's the one behind glasnost, you know.

LIBBY 
Well...yeah. But he told me he was in mergers and acquisitions.

PRICE 
You're not confused, are you?

LIBBY 
No, not really.

CARON 
Gorbachev's not downstairs.

DAISY 
(Smiling) 
Are you Iying?

PRICE 
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's 
at Tunnel.

BATEMAN 
(To Daisy) 
Ask me a question.

DAISY 
So, what do you do?

BATEMAN 
What do you think I do?

DAISY 
A model? An actor?

BATEMAN 
No. Flattering, but no.

DAISY 
Well...

BATEMAN 
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.

DAISY (Unfazed) 
Do you like it?

BATEMAN 
Welt...it depends, why?

DAISY 
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and 
acquisitions don't really like it.

Silence.

BATEMAN 
So, where do you work out?

MUCH LATER IN THE EVENING: 

The club is half-empty now. Price is leaning over a 
balcony, messed-up on drugs. Bateman comes up behind him 
in a menacing way that suggests he might push him over 
the railing. Price turns around, wild-eyed, just as Bateman 
is reaching for him.

PRICE 
(Shouting)
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.

BATEMAN 
Leaving what?

PRICE 
This.

Bateman is confused, he thinks Price is referring to his 
drink.

BATEMAN 
Don't, I'll drink it.

PRICE 
(Screaming) 
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.

BATEMAN 
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?

PRICE 
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!

BATEMAN 
Don't tell me...merchant banking?

PRICE 
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm 
disappearing.

BATEMAN 
(laughing) 
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?

Price looks away.

McDermott and Daisy walk up to them.

McDERMOTT 
Hey-don't worry, be happy.

Price lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is 
shouting something that can't be heard, then

PRICE 
Goodbye! Fuckheads!

He climbs over the railing.

DAISY What is he doing?

BATEMAN 
Price! Come back!

Price leaps from the balcony. He disappears for a moment 
then resurfaces and runs off into the crowd.

EXT. CLUB - NIGHT 
Bateman and Daisy are waiting for a cab.

DAISY 
My ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there, he plays 
in this band that just opened for U2-he couldn't understand 
what I was doing with a yuppie.

BATEMAN 
Oh really?
DAISY 
He said...
(She laughs) 
He said you gave him bad vibes.

BATEMAN 
That's...that's too bad.

DAISY 
You think I'm dumb, don't you?

BATEMAN 
What?

DAISY 
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.

BATEMAN 
(insincerely) No. I really don't.

DAISY 
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.

She takes his hand as they get into a cab.

INT. DAISY'S HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT 

Bateman leaves Daisy's apartment carrying a suitcase. He pauses 
in the hallway and tucks some long blonde hair back inside the 
case.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 

Bateman sits at his desk wearing Wayfarers doing the New York 
Times crossword puzzle at dusk.

Jean knocks gently on the half-open door and walks in with 
a folder in her hand. Bateman ignores her.

JEAN 
Doin' the crossword?

Bateman nods without looking up.

JEAN 
Need help?

BATEMAN doesn't respond. We see that every space on the 
puzzle has been filled in with the words MEAT or BONE. Jean 
drops the folder on his desk and then walks out.

BATEMAN 
Jean?

JEAN 
(Re-enters office) 
Yes, Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?

He erases one of the M's on the crossword puzzle.

BATEMAN 
That is...if you're not doing anything.

JEAN 
Oh no. I have no plans.

BATEMAN 
(Lowering his Wayfarers) 
Well, isn't this a coincidence.

A pause.

BATEMAN 
Listen, where should we go?

He leans back and pulls a Zagat's from the desk drawer.

JEAN 
Anywhere you want?

BATEMAN 
Let's not think about what I want. How about 
anywhere you want.

JEAN 
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.

BATEMAN 
No, come on. Anywhere you want.

JEAN 
Oh, I can't. 
(Sighs) 
I don't know.

BATEMAN 
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want.
Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.

A long pause.

JEAN 
What about...Dorsia?

Bateman stops looking through the Zagat's guide and smiles 
at her.

BATEMAN 
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...

JEAN 
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.

BATEMAN 
Dorsia is...fine.

He dials the number.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia, yes?

BATEMAN 
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at 
nine o'clock?

He checks his Rolex and winks at Jean.

MAITRE D'
We are totally booked.

BATEMAN 
Oh really? That's great.

MAITRE D' 
I said we are totally booked.

BATEMAN 
Two at nine? Perfect.

MAITRE D' 
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is 
also totally booked.

BATEMAN 
See you then.

He hangs up the phone. He walks over to the coat rack. He 
glances over at Jean, who is still standing in front of the 
desk, confused.

BATEMAN 
Yes? You're dressed...okay.

JEAN 
You didn't give them a name.

BATEMAN 
They know me.

Pause.

BATEMAN 
Why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock 
for drinks, okay?

She turns to leave.

BATEMAN 
And Jean? You'll want to change before we go out.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING 

Jean stands by the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking out.

JEAN 
Patrick, it's so...elegant. What a wonderful view.

Bateman opens up the freezer where Daisy's head is cleady 
visible.

BATEMAN 
Jean? Sorbet?

JEAN 
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.

Bateman walks in with a bottle of wine and a corkscrew in 
his hand and hands her the sorbet.

Jean is eating the sorbet.

JEAN 
Want a bite?

BATEMAN 
I'm on a diet. But thank you.

JEAN 
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? 
You look great. Very fit.

BATEMAN 
(Weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness) 
You can always he thinner. Look...better.

JEAN 
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't 
want to ruin your willpower.

BATEMAN 
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling 
it anyway.

Silence, as Bateman walks around his apartment, opens up 
his knife drawer, looking at the knives.

BATEMAN 
So listen, what do you really want to do with your 
life?

Pause.

BATEMAN 
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, 
okay?

JEAN 
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, 
but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life 
where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so...
I don't know...unsure.

Bateman is touching a knife in the drawer, feeling the edge 
of the blade.

BATEMAN 
Do you have a boyfriend?

JEAN 
No, not really.

BATEMAN 
Interesting.

JEAN 
(Shyly) 
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?

BATEMAN 
Maybe. I don't know Not really.
Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very 
Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly
ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, 
twine and a nail gun.

BATEMAN 
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?

JEAN 
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused 
on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about 
changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.

BATEMAN 
Growing. I'm glad you said that.

Bateman picks up the duct tape.

BATEMAN 
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, 
was named Lassie? Had you heard this?

JEAN 
Who's Ted Bundy?

BATEMAN 
Forget it.

JEAN 
What's that?

BATEMAN 
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for...
taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the 
nail gun.

JEAN 
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?

Jean puts her spoon down on the table.

BATEMAN 
(Looking up from loading nails into the gun) 
What...No! Put it in the carton.

JEAN 
Sorry. 
(She puts the spoon in the carton)

BATEMAN 
Jean? What?

JEAN 
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?

From behind, we follow Bateman as he walks across the room and
stands behind the couch.

BATEMAN 
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just 
want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.

JEAN 
Hmmmm. 

He points the nail gun at the back of Jean's head.
The phone RINGS. Startled, Bateman hides the nail gun 
behind his back. The answering machine picks up. As Bateman 
listens he discreetly places the nail gun behind the couch. 
He sits down opposite Jean, enjoying her discomfort as she 
listens to the message.

EVELYN 
Patrick I know you're there. Pick up the phone, you bad boy. 
What are you up to tonight? It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope 
you're not out with some little number you picked up because 
you're my Mr. Bateman. My boy next door. Anyway you never 
called me and you said you would and I'll leave a message for 
Jean about this too to remind you but we're having dinner with 
Melania and Taylor-you know Melania, she went to Sweet Briar, 
auld Taylor, he went to Cornell-and we're meeting at the Cornell 
Club, so l'll call you tomorrow morning probably-bye, honey-oopps! 
You hate that. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO Patrick. Bye. Bye.

Silence. Jean is obviously embarrassed and upset.

JEAN 
Was that...Evelyn?

Silence.

JEAN 
Are you still seeing her?

Silence.

JEAN 
I'm sorry, I have no right to ask that.

Silence.

JEAN 
Do you want me to go?

A long pause.

BATEMAN 
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.

JEAN 
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get 
involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you 
want me to go?

Another long pause.

BATEMAN 
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I 
think I might hurt you. 
(Almost hopefully) 
You don't want to get hurt, do you?

JEAN 
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. 
You're right, I should go.

She gets up to leave.

JEAN 
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with 
Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.

BATEMAN 
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.

He sinks back on the sofa and shuts his eyes.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY 

Bateman enters P&P, walks up the corridor and pauses outside 
the door to his office. He sees KIMBALL in conversation with 
Jean, and Jean looking through her date book. He watches for 
a moment, frozen with anxiety. He then bursts in, shutting 
the door behind him.

BATEMAN 
Kimball-I've been wanting to talk with you, Come 
into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?

Jean looks flustered.

Kimball follows Bateman into his office.

KIMBALL 
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's 
taken a leave of absence.

BATEMAN 
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame. 
(Hopefully) 
Is he a suspect?

KIMBALL 
Not really.

A pause.

KIMBALL 
Do you remember where you were on the night of 
Paul's disappearance? 
(He checks his notebook) 
Which was on the twentieth of December?

BATEMAN 
God...I guess...I was probably returning 
videotapes.

He opens his desk drawer and pretends to search through his 
diary.

BATEMAN 
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.

KIMBALL 
Wait. That's not what I've got.

BATEMAN 
What?

KIMBALL 
That's not the information I've received.

BATEMAN 
Well...I...Wait...What information have 
you received?

KIMBALL 
Let's see...
(He flips through his notebook) 
That you were with-

BATEMAN 
Well, I could he wrong.

KIMBALL 
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?

BATEMAN 
(Clearly nervous and under pressure) 
We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It 
was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner 
at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I 
physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't 
remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.

Kimball is clearly giving up on Bateman for now. He opens 
his briefcase to put away his notebook.

KIMBALL 
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.

BATEMAN 
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long 
day-a bit scattered.

KIMBALL 
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch 
in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?

BATEMAN 
Great, yes, I'd like that.

KIMBALL 
And if you could try and pin down where you were 
the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a 
lot easier.

BATEMAN 
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.

Kimball is rifling through his briefcase. He pulls out a 
new shrink wrapped CD and holds it up.

KIMBALL 
Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I 
just bought it on my way here.

Bateman stares at the CD - stunned, terrified.

BATEMAN 
Never. I mean...I don't really like...
singers.

KIMBALL 
Not a big music fan, eh?

BATEMAN 
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too...
black sounding. For me.

KIMBALL 
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll 
call your secretary about reservations.

BATEMAN 
I'll be there.

EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

The same street corner where Bateman found Christie before. 
The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a 
half-opened window.

CHRISTIE 
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after 
last time...

BATEMAN 
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.

CHRISTIE 
I don't think so.

He hands her a $500 bill.

BATEMAN 
Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. 

The driver's here, you'll be safe.

Christie gets in hesitantly.

BATEMAN 
Nothing like last time, promise.

CHRISTIE 
Alright.

He pours her a shot of vodka and makes her drink it.

BATEMAN 
(Chatting as if they were at a cocktail party) 
So, you're looking great, how have you been?

CHRISTIE 
(A little confused) 
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.

BATEMAN 
(Mock shock) 
Really?

CHRISTIE 
My friend told me I should maybe even get a 
lawyer.

BATEMAN 
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.

He writes her a check for $I ,000 to cash and hands it to 
her. She snatches the check out of his hand and gets 
quickly out of the limo, walking hurriedly down the street.

BATEMAN 
Bitch.

He follows alongside her slowly in the limo, waving a huge 
wad of cash at her. She hesitates; he uses the money to 
lure her into the car. As she reluctantly gets into the 
limo, she reaches for the money.

He snatches it away.

BATEMAN 
Uh uh uh. Half now, half later.

She takes the money and puts it inside her shirt.

BATEMAN 
Okay, your name is Christie. We're meeting a friend of mine, 
Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly. 
You'll like her. She's a very nice girl. Don't say anything 
about yourself. Is that clear. Christie?

Christie nods.

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

The living room: ELIZABETH has kicked off her shoes and flopped 
down on the couch underneath the Baselitz. Elizabeth is an 
attractive, dark-haired society girl who models occasionally. 
Christie is sitting on the couch opposite her, pretending to 
examine a CD.

ELIZABETH 
You look really familiar. Did you you go to Dalton?

Christie shakes her head.

The kitchen: Bateman is grinding up tabs of Ecstasy and 
putting them in a bottle of wine. In the living room, Elizabeth 
is still staring at Christie as if she came from Mars.

ELIZABETH 
I think I met you at Au Bar, didn't I ? With Spicey?

Christie looks blank.

ELIZABETH 
Well, maybe not with Spicey but it was definitely at Au Bar.

Christie still blank.

ELIZABETH 
You know, Au Bar?

Christie shakes her head.

ELIZABETH 
Anyway, Au Bar sucks now, it's terrible. I went to a birth
day party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh my God, please.

Bateman enters carrying the bottle of wine and two glasses.
Christie, who seems frightened, sips her wine and stares at 
the floor. There is an awkward silence.

CHRISTIE 
This is nicer than your other apartment.

BATEMAN 
(Offended that she prefers Owen's apartment) 
It's not that nice.

Silence.

CHRISTIE 
Where did you two meet?

ELIZABETH 
Oh God! I met him at, oh God, the Kentucky Derby in '86-no, 
'87, and...
(Turning to Patrick) 
You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole. 
(Sarcastically) 
Hot number.

BATEMAN 
What do you mean, she was a hot number.

ELIZABETH 
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob. 
(To Christie) 
Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need
I say more?...What do you do?

A long silence. Christie reddens and stares at the floor. 

BATEMAN 
She's my...cousin. 

ELIZABETH 
(Skeptically) 
Uh huh? 

BATEMAN
She's from...France.

A pause. Elizabeth looks at Bateman dubiously. 

ELIZABETH 
Where's your phone? I've got to call Harley.

Bateman hands her a cordless phone. She dials, and stares 
At Christie while she waits for someone to answer. 

ELIZABETH 
Where do you summer? Southampton?

Christie looks at Bateman and then back at Elizabeth.

CHRISTIE 
No.

ELIZABETH 
(Listening to the receiver) 
Oh God, it's his machine.

BATEMAN 
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.

ELIZABETH 
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.

BATEMAN 
Don't tell him you're here.

ELIZABETH 
Why would I?

Bateman has poured her another glass of wine. She downs the
whole glass, making a face.

ELIZABETH 
This tastes weird. 
(She examines the label and shrugs)
Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway 
you'd like. I'm at-

BATEMAN 
(Whispering) 
You're at Paul Owen s.

ELIZABETH 
Who?

BATEMAN 
(Whispering) 
Paul Owen.

ELIZABETH 
I want the number, idiot. 
(She waves him away and continues into the reciever) 
Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I 
don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my 
hairdresser on you.

She hangs up.

ELIZABETH 
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce 
& Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?

BATEMAN 
No.

ELIZABETH 
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.

Bateman sits next to Elizabeth on the couch and pours her 
another glass of the drugged wine.

BATEMAN 
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. 
What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.

ELIZABETH 
(Laughing) 
Patrick, you re a lunatic.

BATEMAN 
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?

ELIZABETH 
Let's not get lewd. 
(Flirty) 
I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.

BATEMAN 
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.

ELIZABETH 
(To Christie) 
Does he do this all the time?

Christie shrugs.

BATEMAN 
Christie, you're not drinking your wine.

Christie looks at her wine and gingerly takes a sip.

BATEMAN 
(To Elizabeth) 
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?

ELIZABETH 
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?

BATEMAN 
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

ELIZABETH 
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me 
feel weird.

LATER:

Elizabeth is now writhing around on the couch and making 
out with Christie. Bateman holds up a Whitney Houston CD, 
showing them the picture of Whitney on the cover.

BATEMAN 
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP 
called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles 
on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps 
across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's 
mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album 
on a first listening.

ELIZABETH 
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You 
actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?

She giggles, rolling off the sofa onto the floor.

BATEMAN 
(Ignoring her) 
It's hard to choose a favorite track 
among so many great ones, but "The Greatest Love of All" 
is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about 
self-preservation and dignity. It's universal message 
crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope 
that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder. 
Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in 
to empathize with others, we can always empathize with 
ourselves.

As he speaks, he opens the case and carefully places the CD 
in the player, admiring its pristine silver surface, and 
watches it slide into the machine.

BATEMAN 
It's an important message, crucial, really, and it's 
beautifully stated on the album.

INT. BEDROOM - LATER 

AN OUT-OF-FOCUS HOME VIDEO SHOT of Elizabeth, Christie and 
Bateman in the throes of sex, in the master bedroom.

CUT BACK TO WIDE SHOT of the bedroom, partially blocked by 
the video camera in the foreground. Their bodies are an 
incoherent tangle of arms and legs. The only sounds are 
moans, heavy breathing and the slapping of flesh against 
flesh. CLOSE ON Christie's head and shoulders. Her eyes are 
shut as she grimly concentrates on giving a good professional 
performance, turning her head every so often to check the 
progress of her partners.

OFFSCREEN WE HEAR Elizabeth panting in genuine pleasure, 
moaning loudly. Her voice gets louder and louder and then 
shifts to actual pain.

Bateman rises up off the bed, suddenly appearing behind 
Christie. There is blood on his face.

Christie turns her head and sees him. She screams and leaps 
off the bed, running out of the room. She slams the 
mirrored door behind her, and as it swings shut for a split 
second we see Elizabeth writhing in pain on the bed.

We follow Christie out of the room, panicking, screaming.

Christie runs down a darkened hallway, frantically opening 
doors, looking for an escape.

She hears the SOUND OF A CHAINSAW coming from the bedroom.

She opens a closet. The closet lights up as she opens the 
door and sees two dead, women hanging inside. She screams, 
then claps a hand over her mouth. She stops and listens. THE 
DISTANT SOUND OF THE CHAINSAW.

She backs away slowly, into another dark room, lit only by 
the light from a television set. Through the darkness she 
sees a head on the top of the TV and starts to whimper.

She runs toward the nearest door. Finding herself in the 
main hallway, she begins to jog toward the front door, then 
runs.

Bateman appears from nowhere, holding the chainsaw, 
spattered with blood.

Christie screams and changes direction. Bateman leaps at 
her, bellowing.

They run through the bedroom and into the bathroom. 
Christie trips over Elizabeth's body, which is half in the 
bathtub.

Both are slipping on the floor, which is slick with blood.

Christie falls, tries to get up. Bateman grabs her leg. He 
tries to bite it.

She kicks him in the face and gets up, running toward the 
front door.

He runs after her.

BATEMAN 
Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you 
piece of bitch trash!

Christie, screaming, makes it out the front door.

Bateman runs after her.

She runs down the hall screaming and banging on doors.

She moves to the elevator, pounding hysterically on the 
buttons. She sees the stairwell and runs for it.

Bateman sees this and runs after her, revving the chainsaw.

She runs down the stairs, Bateman two flights behind her. 
He stops, leans over the railing to look at her, then aims 
the chainsaw at her and drops it.

Christie SCREAMS OFFSCREEN, then is suddenly silent.

FROM BATEMAN'S POV we see Christie's body sprawled facedown 
at the bottom of the stairwell. The chainsaw sticks out of 
her back like a sword.

INT. CRAYONS - EARLY EVENING 

An insanely expensive restaurant with a childhood motif: paper 
tablecloths and jars of crayons for drawing, lots of primary 
colors, and a goldfish bowl on each table.

Bateman is at a table with Evelyn. They are both drawing on 
the tablecloth. Bateman is drawing Christie with the 
chainsaw in her back.

EVELYN 
I want a firm commitment.

BATEMAN 
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.

Evelyn waves to a couple across the room.

EVELYN 
(Distracted) 
Why? What's wrong?

BATEMAN 
(Speaking very carefully, measuring each word) 
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale 
cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill 
my needs.

The woman across the room holds up her hand, displaying a
new bracelet. Evelyn smiles and nods approvingly.

BATEMAN 
We need to talk.

EVELYN 
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk 
about?

BATEMAN 
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over

EVELYN 
(Motioning to the waiter for water) 
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just 
avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?

BATEMAN 
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This 
is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.

EVELYN 
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your 
friends. I don't think it would work. 
(Reaching over to dab his face with a napkin) 
You have a little something on your upper lip.

BATEMAN 
(Brushing her hand away) 
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about 
that. You can have them.

Evelyn stares at him, suspicious and bewildered, a 
realization dawning.

EVELYN 
You're really serious, aren't you?

BATEMAN 
Yes, I am.

EVELYN 
But what about the past? Our past?

BATEMAN 
We never really shared one.

EVELYN 
You're inhuman.

BATEMAN 
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry. 
(He pauses, as if searching for the right words) 
You're just not terribly important to me.

Evelyn begins to cry.

EVELYN 
No, no, no.

BATEMAN 
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.

She reaches desperately across the table and takes his 
hand. Bateman pulls his hand away.

EVELYN 
(Sobbing) 
What do you want me to do, what is it you want?

The occupants of nearby tables begin to stare. Bateman is
becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed.

BATEMAN 
(Looking uncomfortably around the room) 
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making 
this scene right now.

EVELYN 
Oh God, I can't believe this.

BATEMAN 
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.

Evelyn makes an effort to compose herself. She blots the 
tears so they will not affect her make-up.

EVELYN 
(Surprisingly calm) 
Where are you going?

BATEMAN 
I'm just leaving.

EVELYN 
But where?

BATEMAN 
I have to return some videotapes.

He rushes out of the room.

EXT. TRIBECA STREET - EVENING 

Bateman wanders into misty Tribeca streets, sees a stray cat.

BATEMAN 
Here kitty, kitty.

The small mangy cat rubs against him. He picks it up and 
walks toward an ATM, holding the cat. He puts his card in 
the machine. The screen reads: FEED ME A STRAY CAT.
Bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the 
deposit slot with some difficulty. The kitten squeals. He 
takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the 
kitten. He doesn't notice the woman waiting behind him.

WOMAN 
Oh my God! Stop that! What are you doing?

Bateman wheels around and shoots her. She falls screaming 
to the floor.

Responding to the gunshot, A POLICE CAR SIREN WAILS in the 
distance. Bateman breaks into a run. The police car 
screeches after him.

COP CAR (O.S.)
HALT STOP. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON.

Bateman ducks down an alley.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 

A COP rushes toward him, seemingly from 
out of nowhere, and tackles him, trying to get the gun away 
from him.

Bateman manages to shoot the cop in the face while both of 
them have their hands on the gun, then shoots him again. He 
reloads the gun. The sound of more COP CARS arriving.

He runs out of the alley.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

As he reaches the street, he finds A PHALANX OF POLICE CARS
approaching.

COP CAR 
Halt. Put down your weapon.

The cops leap out and fire a warning shot in the air. 
Bateman shoots at them. The police return fire.

Bateman ducks down behind a parked car and continues
shooting wildly. A bullet hits the gas tank of one of the 
police cars. It catches fire and explodes. The flames light 
up the scene, illuminating the bodies of policemen both living 
and dead.

NEW ANGLE: Bateman flees from the scene. The camera follows 
him as he runs along a row of Porsches, trying to open each 
one, setting off a cacophony of CAR ALARMS.
THE SOUND OF POLICE SIRENS draws near.

NEW ANGLE: He runs, panting, until he ends up in front of a 
tail, brilliantly lit office building. As he approaches, 
the lights in the building are going off floor by floor.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT 

He rushes into the lobby, running for the elevator.

NIGHT WATCHMAN 
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? You 
forgot to sign in.

Bateman wheels around and shoots him. He runs toward the 
revolving doors. As he swings around in the doors, he 
notices a JANITOR who has witnessed the shooting. He 
revolves back into the lobby and shoots the janitor.

NEW ANGLE: 

He runs out of the building and across the 
street to an identical office building, the one that houses 
Pierce & Pierce.

INT. PIERCE & PIERCE LOBBY - NIGHT 

Bateman nods at the Pierce & Pierce NIGHT WATCHMAN and signs 
in. He breathes a sigh of relief as the elevator doors close 
behind him.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT 

Bateman stands looking out 
through the floor-length windows at a panoramic night view 
of the city and the river.

Below him he sees a SWAT TEAM swarming over the roof of the 
opposite building. There are ambulances standing by, flares 
everywhere, distant sirens.

Suddenly, THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER draws near. Frightened, 
he drops to the floor behind his desk.

Helicopter searchlights scan the building, illuminating 
Bateman's office for a few moments with a blaze of light.

He is crouched in one corner, half-sobbing, talking into 
the phone, as the searchlight keeps circling.

BATEMAN 
Harold, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman. You're my 
lawyer so I think you should know-I've killed a lot of 
people. Some escort girls, in an apartment uptown, some 
homeless people, maybe five or ten, an NYU girl I met in 
Central Park. I left her in a parking lot, near Dunkin' 
Donuts. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail 
gun. and a man, some old faggot with a dog. Last week I 
killed another girl with a chainsaw-I had to, she almost 
got away There was someone else there, maybe a model, I 
can't remember but she's dead too. And Paul Owen. I killed 
Paul Owen with an ax, in the face. His body is dissolving 
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything 
out here...I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40-I have tapes 
of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even...
well, I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little. 
Tonight I just, well, I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not 
sure I 'm going to get away with it this time-I mean I guess 
I'm a pretty sick guy. So-if you get hack tomorrow, I may show 
up at Harry's Bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open.

Bateman hangs up the phone. The helicopter searchlight 
circles back, briefly illuminating the room. The camera rises 
up over Bateman huddled in the corner, staring blankly at the 
sky.

INT. SMITH AND WOLLENSKY RESTAURANT - DAY 

KIMBALL and Bateman are sitting at a corner table.

KIMBALL 
(Very surprised) 
No hash browns? 

BATEMAN 
Not in the mood, I guess.

KIMBALL 
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I 
mean- it's-have you been here before?

BATEMAN 
(Deliberately nonchalant) 
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not...
ordering them.

KIMBALL 
(Looking at him like he's nuts) 
Suit yourself, I guess.

Pause.

KIMBALL 
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on 
what you did?

BATEMAN 
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some 
sorbet?

KIMBALL 
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.

BATEMAN 
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?

KIMBALL 
According to his date book, and this was verified by his 
secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.

BATEMAN 
And?

KIMBALL 
I've questioned him.

BATEMAN 
Marcus?

KIMBALL 
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't 
be sure.

BATEMAN 
But Marcus denied it?

KIMBALL 
Yes.

BATEMAN 
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?

KIMBALL 
Yes.

A pause.

BATEMAN 
He does? You're sure?

KIMBALL 
(smiling)
I checked it out. It's clean.

BATEMAN 
Oh.
KIMBALL Now where were you? 
(He laughs) 

BATEMAN 
(Laughing with him) 
Where was Marcus? 

KIMBALL 
He wasn't with Paul 
Owen. 

BATEMAN 
So who was he with? 

KIMBALL 
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, 
Harry Newman, George Butner and – 
(He pauses, Then looks up) 
- you.

A moment of stunned silence.

BATEMAN 
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen 
to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner 
with Victoria...the following night. 

KIMBALL 
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for 
a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. 
Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or 
later. 
(A pause) 
I mean, to think that one of his friends 
killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too 
ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick? 

McDermott stops by the table. 

McDERMOTT 
KIMBALL! How's the investigation? 
Talking to Bateman? Don't believe a word he says. 
(Laughs uproariously slapping him on the back) 
Bateman, what's wrong with ,you? 

Bateman looks at him in silence, 
panicking. 

McDERMOTT 
You can't eat at Smith and Wollensky 
without ordering the hash browns. Jesus, Bateman, you're a 
raving maniac. Been at Pierce & Pierce too long. 
(He wanders off muttering) 
No fucking hash browns...

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Bateman walks into the lobby of Paul Owen's building. He 
has a surgical mask in one hand.

DOORMAN 
What can I do for you, sir?

BATEMAN 
20B.

DOORMAN 
Of course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right now.

BATEMAN 
Mrs. Wolfe?

DOORMAN 
The real estate agent? You do have an appointment,
don't you?

Bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down
the hallway. Owen's door is open. The apartment is freshly 
painted and has been immaculately redecorated in English 
country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. There 
are flowers everywhere, and a YOUNG YUPPIE COUPLE stands 
admiring the place talkingto the realtor, MRS. WOLFE. Bateman 
wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. He stops 
at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. He 
opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. Mrs. 
Wolfe approaches, smiling.

MRS. WOLFE 
Are you my two o'clock?

BATEMAN 
No.

Mrs. Wolfe eyes him strangely, then looks down at the 
surgical mash clutched in his hand. Her expression changes.

MRS. WOLFE 
Can I help you?

BATEMAN
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.

She stares at him impassively.

BATEMAN 
Doesn't he live here?

MRS. WOLFE 
No, he doesn't.

BATEMAN 
Are you sure?

MRS. WOLFE 
You saw the ad in the Times?

BATEMAN 
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But...
doesn't Paul Owen still live here?

MRS. WOLFE 
There was no ad in the Times.

Bateman is shaking as they continue to stare at each other.

MRS. WOLFE 
I think you should go now.

BATEMAN 
But I think...I want to know what happened 
here.

MRS. WOLFE 
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.

Bateman backs away slowly.

MRS. WOLFE 
Don't come back.

BATEMAN 
I won't...don't worry.

Mrs. Wolfe glares at him as he walks down the hall, 
rattled, and gets into the elevator.

EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 

Bateman enters the revolving 
door of an office building, panicking and breathing 
heavily. He is sweating, his hair is wild, and he looks 
deranged. He goes around the revolving door twice and comes 
out onto the street again, where he bumps smack into a GUY 
just like him.

GUY 
Hey, Kinsley.

Bateman looks up at him wild-eyed.

GUY 
See you at Fluties, okay?

The guy walks away, utterly unfazed. Bateman wanders down 
the street, banging his briefcase against walls, garbage 
cans, etc.

EXT. MIDTOWN PHONE BOOTH - DAY 

Bateman searches his pockets 
for pills. He finds three different pills and swallows 
them. He's sweating, and takes his jacket off to wipe his 
face, dialing a number.

JEAN (O.S.) 
Patrick Bateman's office.

BATEMAN 
Jean? Hello? Jean?

JEAN (O.S.) 
Patrick? Is that you?

BATEMAN 
Hello? Jean, I need help!

JEAN (O.S.)
Where are you?

BATEMAN 
Jean-I'm not-

JEAN (O.S.) 
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and 
David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.

BATEMAN 
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?

JEAN (O.S.) 
Patrick? I can't hear you.

BATEMAN 
What are I doing?

JEAN (O.S.) 
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?

BATEMAN 
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.

Pause.

BATEMAN 
...to the office this afternoon.

JEAN (O.S.) 
Why?

BATEMAN 
(Screaming) 
Just...say...no!

JEAN (O.S.) 
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?

BATEMAN 
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!

He hangs up. He throws the Walkman which is around his neck 
into a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his 
jacket.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE- SAME DAY 

Jean sits at Bateman's desk. She looks around, and then opens 
his desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it.

INT. HARRY'S BAR - EVENING 

Bateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the 
previous scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking 
and disheveled. He spots his friends in a corner, sits down, 
still breathing heavily.

Price is on his cell-phone, trying to get reservations.

McDERMOTT 
Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough 
day at the office?

They all laugh.

McDERMOTT 
Hey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking 
Perrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't 
get a reservation to save his life.

Bateman sits down silently.

McDERMOTT 
Why don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them.

BATEMAN 
(On automatic) 
I'm not going anywhere unless we 
have a reservation.

VAN PATTEN Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, come on, 
faggots-just get a res.

PRICE 
Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders.

Bateman spots HAROLD CARNES at the bar, tenses. 

BATEMAN 
(He downs his drink) 
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back.
He approaches Carnes cautiously. 

CARNES 
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the 
end of the '90s.

Bateman approaches, trying to act casual.

BATEMAN 
Shut up, Carnes, they will not.

Carnes is surprised, turns around, looks vaguely confused.

BATEMAN 
So, Harold, did you get my message?

Carnes lights a cigarette, stalling. Then laughs.

CARNES 
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, 
wasn't it?

BATEMAN 
(Waving smoke out of his face) 
Yes, naturally.

CARNES 
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s 
fabulous. That's rich...

Pause

CARNES 
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?

BATEMAN 
What exactly do you mean?

CARNES 
The message you left.

Carnes is distracted, waving at people.

CARNES 
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still 
seeing her, right?

BATEMAN 
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?

Carnes isn't really listening.

CARNES 
Excuse me. Nothing. Good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?

He turns to go.

BATEMAN 
Carnes? Wait.

CARNES 
(Sighing) 
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. 
But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, 
such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully 
appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said 
Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's 
have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.

BATEMAN 
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?

CARNES 
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let 
alone...what was it you said he did to her?

Carnes looks around the club, raises his glass to a passing 
couple. He laughs politely.

CARNES 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...

BATEMAN 
(Desperate, shouting) 
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really 
comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. 
I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. 
I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your 
machine was true.

CARNES 
Excuse me. I really must he going.

BATEMAN 
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm 
Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! 
Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.

Carnes stares at him in confusion and annoyance.

BATEMAN 
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed 
Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer

CARNES 
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find 
this funny anymore.

BATEMAN 
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?

CARNES 
(Eyeing Bateman worriedly)
It's just not.

BATEMAN 
Why not, you stupid bastard?

Carnes stares at him.

CARNES 
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in 
London...just ten days ago.

BATEMAN 
No, you...didn't?

CARNES 
Now, if you'll excuse me.

Bateman returns back to his friends' table, in a daze.
They are all looking at the television, where Ronald 
Reagan is giving a speech about Iran Contra. They are 
halfheartedly arguing about whether or not he's 
lying.

PRICE 
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?

VAN PATTEN 
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? 
I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have 
reservations somewhere.

PRICE 
(To Bateman) 
I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so...
out of it. So...undangerous.

McDERMOTT 
He is totally harmless you geek. Was totally harmless.
Just like you are totally harmless. But he did do all that 
shit and you have failed lo get us into I 50, so, you know, 
what can I say?

PRICE 
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that 
way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so 
fucking, I don't know, cool about it?

VAN PATTEN 
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.

Bateman laughs at this. Price shoots him a look.

PRICE 
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?

BATEMAN 
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'.
VAN PATTEN 
(To Price) Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. 
Working for UNICEF now?

McDERMOTT 
Do you want another Perrier Timothy? Some seltzer water?

PRICE 
Oh brother look-he presents himself as a harmless 
Old codger. But inside...

Pause.

PRICE 
But inside...

The SOUNDS OF THE BAR FADE AWAY and we hear Bateman's thoughts:

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
But inside doesn't matter...

THE SOUNDS OF THE BAR RETURN.

McDERMOTT 
(Bored)
Inside? Yes, inside? Believe it or not, Price we're actually 
listening to you.

PRICE 
Bateman? Come on, what do you think? 

Bateman looks up and smiles at Price. Then shrugs.

BATEMAN 
Whatever.

The conversation breaks up as Van Patten takes out his phone. 

VAN PATTEN 
Whose moronic idea was it to drink dry beers? I need a Scotch.

The sounds of the bar fade down. The following voiceover runs 
over images of Bateman and his friends ordering drinks, talking 
on portable phones, talking, laughing - combined with images of 
other very similar young men at other tables drinking, talking 
on portable phones, talking, laughing,

BATEMAN (V.O.)
There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with 
the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, 
all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward 
it, I have now surpassed...

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Jean is alone in Bateman's office, looking through his diary. 
We see the pages that she is looking at. They are filled with 
doodles of mutilated women and their names...Jean looks lost 
and frightened, and begins to cry.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better 
world for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be inflicted on 
others. I want no escape.

INT. HARRY'S BAR - EARLY EVENING 
As the film ends the camera moves CLOSE on Bateman. He is 
leaning back in his leather armchair, drinking a double Scotch, 
his eyes blank.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. I gain no 
deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted 
from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any 
of this. This confession has meant nothing...

The camera moves up to a sign on the wall behind him: 
"THIS IS NOT AN EXIT."

                         BUD (V.O.)
            On November first, 1959, the
            population of New York City was
            8,042,783.  if you laid all these
            people end to end, figuring an
            average height of five feet six and
            a half inches, they would reach
            from Times Square to the outskirts
            of Karachi, Pakistan.  I know facts
            like this because I work for an
            insurance company --

THE INSURANCE BUILDING - A WET, FALL DAY

It's a big mother, covering a square block in lower
Manhattan, all glass and aluminum, jutting into the leaden
sky.

                         BUD (V.O.)
            -- Consolidated Life of New York.
            We are one of the top five companies
            in the country -- last year we
            wrote nine-point-three billion
            dollars worth of policies.  Our
            home office has 31,259 employees --
            which is more than the entire
            population of Natchez, Mississippi,
            of Gallup, New Mexico.

INT. NINETEENTH FLOOR

Acres of gray steel desk, gray steel filing cabinets, and
steel-gray faces under indirect light.  One wall is lined
with glass-enclosed cubicles for the supervisory personnel.
It is all very neat, antiseptic, impersonal.  The only human
tough is supplied by a bank of IBM machines, clacking away
cheerfully in the background.

                         BUD (V.O.)
            I work on the nineteenth floor --
            Ordinary Policy Department -
            Premium Accounting Division -
            Section W -- desk number 861.
DESK 861

Like every other desk, it has a small name plate attached to
the side.  This one reads C.C. BAXTER.

                         BUD (V.O.)
            My name is C.C. Baxter - C. for
            Calvin, C. for Clifford -- however,
            most people call me Bud. I've been
            with Consolidated Life for three
            years and ten months.  I started in
            the branch office in Cincinnati,
            then transferred to New York.  My
            take-home pay is $94.70 a week, and
            there are the usual fringe benefits.

BAXTER is about thirty, serious, hard-working, unobtrusive.
He wears a Brooks Brothers type suit, which he bought
somewhere on Seventh Avenue, upstairs.  There is a stack of
perforated premium cards in front of him, and he is totaling
them on the computing machine.  He looks off.

ELECTRIC WALL CLOCK

It shows 5:19.  With a click, the minute hand jumps to 5:20,
and a piercing bell goes off.

                         BUD (V.O.)
            The hours in our department are
            8:50 to 5:20 --

FULL SHOT - OFFICE

Instantly all work stops.  Papers are being put away,
typewriters and computing machines are covered, and everybody
starts clearing out.  Within ten seconds, the place is
empty -- except for Bud Baxter, still bent over his work,
marooned in a sea of abandoned desks.

                         BUD (V.O.)
            -- they're staggered by floors, so
            that sixteen elevators can handle
            the 31,259 employees without a
            serious traffic jam.  As for
            myself, I very often stay on at the
            office and work for an extra hour
            or two -- especially when the
            weather is bad.  It's not that I'm
            overly ambitious -- it's just a way
            of killing time, until it's all
            right for me to go home.
            You see, I have this little problem
            with my apartment --

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

STREET IN THE WEST SIXTIES - EVENING

Bud, wearing a weather-beaten Ivy League raincoat and a
narrow-brimmed brown hat, comes walking slowly down the
street skirting the puddles on the sidewalk.  He stops in
front of a converted brownstone, looks up.

                         BUD (V.O.)
            I live in the West Sixties - just
            half a block from Central Park.  My
            rent is $84 a month.  It used to be
            eighty until last July when Mrs.
            Lieberman, the landlady, put in a
            second-hand air conditioning unit.

The windows on the second floor are lit, but the shades are
drawn.  From inside drifts the sound of cha cha music.

                         BUD (V.O.)
            It's a real nice apartment -
            nothing fancy -- but kind of
            cozy -- just right for a bachelor.
            The only problem is - I can't
            always get in when I want to.

INT. THE APARTMENT - EVENING

What used to be the upstairs parlor of a one-family house in
the early 1900's has been chopped up into living room,
bedroom, bathroom and kitchen.  The wallpaper is faded, the
carpets are threadbare, and the upholstered furniture could
stand shampooing.  There are lots of books, a record player,
stacks of records, a television set (21 inches and 24
payments), unframed prints from the Museum of Modern Art
(Picasso, Braque, Klee) tacked up on the walls.

Only one lamp is lit, for mood, and a cha cha record is
spinning around on the phonograph.  On the coffee table in
front of the couch are a couple of cocktail glasses, a
pitcher with some martini dregs, an almost empty bottle of
vodka, a soup bowl with a few melting ice cubes at the
bottom, some potato chips, an ashtray filled with cigar
stubs and lipstick-stained cigarette butts, and a woman's
handbag.

MR. KIRKEBY, a dapper, middle-aged man, stands in front of
the mirror above the fake fireplace, buttoning up his vest.
He does not notice that the buttons are out of alignment.

                         KIRKEBY
                   (calling off)
            Come on, Sylvia.  It's getting late.

SYLVIA, a first baseman of a dame, redheaded and saftig,
comes cha cha-ing into the room, trying to fasten a necklace
as she hums along with the music.  She dances amorously up
to Kirkeby.

                         KIRKEBY
            Cut it out, Sylvia.  We got to get
            out of here.

He helps her with the necklace, then turns off the phonograph.

                         SYLVIA
            What's the panic?  I'm going to
            have another martooni.

She crosses to the coffee table, starts to pour the remnants
of the vodka into the pitcher.

                         KIRKEBY
            Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to
            nine!

                         SYLVIA
                   (dropping slivers of
                   ice into the pitcher)
            First you can't wait to get me up
            here, and now -- rush, rush, rush!
            Makes a person feel cheap.

                         KIRKEBY
            Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not
            that -- but I promised the guy I'd
            be out of here by eight o'clock,
            positively.

                         SYLVIA
                   (pouring martini)
            What guy?  Whose apartment is this,
            anyway?

                         KIRKEBY
                   (exasperated)
            What's the difference?  Some
            schnook that works in the office.

EXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - EVENING

Bud is pacing back and forth, throwing an occasional glance
at the lit windows of his apartment.  A middle-aged woman
with a dog on a leash approaches along the sidewalk.

She is MRS. LIEBERMAN, the dog is a Scottie, and they are
both wearing raincoats.  Seeing them, Bud leans casually
against the stoop.

                         MRS. LIEBERMAN
            Good evening, Mr. Baxter.

                         BUD
            Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.

                         MRS. LIEBERMAN
            Some weather we're having.  Must be
            from all the meshugass at Cape
            Canaveral.
                   (she is half-way up
                   the steps)
            You locked out of your apartment?

                         BUD
            No, no.  Just waiting for a friend.
            Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.

                         MRS. LIEBERMAN
            Good night, Mr. Baxter.

She and the Scottie disappear into the house.  Bud resumes
pacing, his eyes on the apartment windows.  Suddenly he
stops -- the lights have gone out.

INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - EVENING

Kirkeby, in coat and hat, stands in the open doorway of the
darkened apartment.

                         KIRKEBY
            Come on -- come on, Sylvia!

Sylvia comes cha cha-ing out, wearing an imitation Persian
lamb coat, her hat askew on her head, bag, gloves, and an
umbrella in her hand.

                         SYLVIA
            Some setup you got here.  A real,
            honest-to-goodness love nest.

                         KIRKEBY
            Sssssh.

He locks the door, slips the key under the doormat.

                         SYLVIA
                   (still cha cha-ing)
            You're one button off, Mr. Kirkeby.

She points to his exposed vest.  Kirkeby looks down, sees
that the buttons are out of line.  He starts to rebutton
them as they move down the narrow, dimly-lit stairs.

                         SYLVIA
            You got to watch those things.
            Wives are getting smarter all the
            time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the
            Claims Department -- came home one
            night with lipstick on his shirt --
            told his wife he had a shrimp
            cocktail for lunch -- so she took
            it out to the lab and had it
            analyzed -- so now she has the
            house in Great Neck and the children
            and the new Jaguar --

                         KIRKEBY
            Don't you ever stop talking?

EXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - EVENING

Bud, standing on the sidewalk, sees the front door start to
open.  He moves quickly into the areaway, almost bumping
into the ashcans, stands in the shadow of the stoop with his
back turned discreetly toward Kirkeby and Sylvia as they
come down the steps.

                         KIRKEBY
            Where do you live?

                         SYLVIA
            I told you -- with my mother.

                         KIRKEBY
            Where does she live?

                         SYLVIA
            A hundred and seventy-ninth
            street -- the Bronx.

                         KIRKEBY
            All right -- I'll take you to the
            subway.

                         SYLVIA
            Like hell you will.  You'll buy me
            a cab.

                         KIRKEBY
            Why do all you dames have to live
            in the Bronx?

                         SYLVIA
            You mean you bring other girls up
            here?

                         KIRKEBY
            Certainly not.  I'm a happily
            married man.

They move down the street.  Bud appears from the areaway,
glances after them, then mounts the steps, goes through the
front door.

INT. VESTIBULE - EVENING

There are eight mailboxes.  Bud opens his, takes out a
magazine in a paper wrapper and a few letters, proceeds up
the staircase.

INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - EVENING

Bud, glancing through his mail, comes up to the door of his
apartment.  As he bends down to lift the doormat, the door
of the rear apartment opens and MRS. DREYFUSS, a jovial
well-fed middle-aged woman, puts out a receptacle full of
old papers and empty cans.  Bud looks around from his bent
position.

                         BUD
            Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

                         MRS. DREYFUSS
            Something the matter?

                         BUD
            I seem to have dropped my key.
                   (faking a little search)
            Oh -- here it is.

He slides it out from under the mat, straightens up.

                         MRS. DREYFUSS
            Such a racket I heard in your
            place -- maybe you had burglars.

                         BUD
            Oh, you don't have to worry about
            that -- nothing in there that
            anybody would want to steal...
                   (unlocking door quickly)
            Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

He ducks into the apartment.

INT. THE APARTMENT - EVENING

Bud snaps on the lights, drops the mail and the key on a
small table, looks around with distaste at the mess his
visitors have left behind.  He sniffs the stale air, crosses
to the window, pulls up the shade, opens it wide.  Now he
takes off his hat and raincoat, gathers up the remains of
the cocktail party from the coffee table.  Loaded down with
glasses, pitcher, empty vodka bottle, ice bowl and potato
chips, he starts toward the kitchen.

The doorbell rings.  Bud stops, undecided what to do with
the stuff in his hands, then crosses to the hall door,
barely manages to get it open.  Mr. Kirkeby barges in past
him.

                         KIRKEBY
            The little lady forgot her galoshes.

He scours the room for the missing galoshes.

                         BUD
            Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to
            complain -- but you were supposed
            to be out of here by eight.

                         KIRKEBY
            I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But
            those things don't always run on
            schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.

                         BUD
            I don't mind in the summer -- but
            on a rainy night -- and I haven't
            had any dinner yet --

                         KIRKEBY
            Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in
            a good word for you with Sheldrake,
            in Personnel.

                         BUD
                   (perking up)
            Mr. Sheldrake?

                         KIRKEBY
            That's right.  We were discussing
            our department -- manpower-wise --
            and promotion-wise --
                   (finds the galoshes
                   behind a chair)
            -- and I told him what a bright boy
            you were.  They're always on the
            lookout for young executives.
                         BUD
            Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.

                         KIRKEBY
                   (starting toward door)
            You're on your way up, Buddy-boy.
            And you're practically out of liquor.

                         BUD
            I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the
            Mortgage Loan Department -- last
            night he had a little Halloween
            party here --

                         KIRKEBY
            Well, lay in some vodka and some
            vermouth -- and put my name on it.

                         BUD
            Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me
            for the last two bottles --

                         KIRKEBY
            I'll pay you on Friday.
                   (in the open doorwaY)
            And whatever happened to those
            little cheese crackers you used to
            have around?

He exits, shutting the door.

                         BUD
                   (making a mental note)
            Cheese crackers.

He carries his load into the kitchen.

The kitchen is minute and cluttered.  On the drainboard are
an empty vermouth bottle, some ice-cube trays, a jar with
one olive in it, and a crumpled potato-chip bag.

Bud comes in, dumps his load on the drainboard, opens the
old-fashioned refrigerator.  He takes out a frozen chicken
dinner, turns the oven on, lights it with a match, rips the
protective paper off the aluminum tray and shoves it in.

Now he starts to clean up the mess on the drainboard.  He
rinses the cocktail glasses, is about to empty the martini
pitcher into the sink, thinks better of it.  He pours the
contents into a glass, plops the lone olive out of the jar,
scoops up the last handful of potato chips, toasts an
imaginary companion, and drinks up.  Then he pulls a
wastebasket from under the sink.

It is brimful of liquor bottles, and Bud adds the empty
vodka and vermouth bottles and the olive jar.  Picking up
the heavy receptacle, he carries it through the living room
toward the hall door.

INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - EVENING

The door of Bud's apartment opens, and Bud comes out with
the wastebasket full of empty bottles.  Just then, DR. DAVID
DREYFUSS, whose wife we met earlier, comes trudging up the
stairs.  He is a tall, heavy-set man of fifty, with a bushy
mustache, wearing a bulky overcoat and carrying an aged
medical bag.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Good evening, Baxter.

                         BUD
            Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's
            57th Street ate a club sandwich,
            and forgot to take out the toothpick.

                         BUD
            Oh.
                   (sets down wastebasket)
            'Bye, Doc.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (indicating bottles)
            Say, Baxter -- the way you're
            belting that stuff, you must have a
            pair of cast-iron kidneys.

                         BUD
            Oh, that's not me.  It's just that
            once in a while, I have some people
            in for a drink.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            As a matter of fact, you must be an
            iron man all around. From what I
            hear through the walls, you got
            something going for you every night.

                         BUD
            I'm sorry if it gets noisy --

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Sometimes,  there's a twi-night
            double-header.
                   (shaking his head)
            A nebbish like you!

                         BUD
                   (uncomfortable)
            Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc.
                   (starts to back
                   through door)


                         DR. DREYFUSS
            You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some
            research at the Columbia Medical
            Center -- and I wonder if you could
            do us a favor?

                         BUD
            Me?

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            When you make out your will -- and
            the way you're going, you should --
            would you mind leaving your body to
            the University?

                         BUD
            My body?  I'm afraid you guys would
            be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Slow down, kid.

He starts into the rear apartment as Bud closes the door.

INT. THE APARTMENT - EVENING

Bud, loosening his tie, goes into the kitchen, opens the
oven, turns off the gas.  He takes a coke out of the
refrigerator, uncaps it, gets a knife and fork from a
drawer, and using his handkerchief as a potholder, pulls the
hot aluminum tray out of the oven.  He carries everything
out into the living room.

In the living room, Bud sets his dinner down on the coffee
table, settles himself on the couch.  He rears up as
something stabs him, reaches under his buttocks, pulls out a
hairpin.  He drops it into an ashtray, tackles his dinner.
Without even looking, he reaches over to the end table and
presses the remote TV station-selector.  He takes a sip from
the coke bottle, his eyes on the TV screen across the room.

The picture on the TV set jells quickly.  Against a
background of crisscrossing searchlights, a pompous announcer
is making his spiel.

                         ANNOUNCER
            -- from the world's greatest
            library of film classics, we
            proudly present --
                   (fanfare)
            Greta Garbo -- John Barrymore --
            Joan Crawford -- Wallace Beery --
            and Lionel Barrymore in --
                   (fanfare)
            GRAND HOTEL!

There is an extended fanfare.  Bud leans forward, chewing
excitedly on a chicken leg.

                         ANNOUNCER
            But first, a word from our sponsor.
            If you smoke the modern way, don't
            be fooled by phony filter claims --

Bud, still eating, automatically reaches for the station-
selector, pushes the button.

A new channel pops on.  It features a Western -- Cockamamie
Indians are attacking a stagecoach.

That's not for Bud.  He switches to another station.  In a
frontier saloon, Gower Street cowboys are dismantling the
furniture and each other.

Bud wearily changes channels.  But he can't get away from
Westerns -- on this station, the U.S. Cavalry is riding to
the rescue.  Will they get there in time?

Bud doesn't wait to find out.  He switches channels again,
and is back where he started.

On the screen, once more, is the announcer standing in front
of the crisscrossing searchlights.

                         ANNOUNCER
            And now, Grand Hotel -- starring
            Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan
            Crawford --
                   (Bud is all eyes and
                   ears again)
            -- Wallace Beery, and Lionel
            Barrymore.  But first -- a word
            from our alternate sponsor.
                   (unctuously)
            Friends, do you have wobbly
            dentures -- ?

That does it.  Bud turns the set off in disgust.

The TV screen blacks out, except for a small pinpoint of
light in the center, which gradually fades away.

In the bathroom, Bud, in pajamas by now, is brushing his
teeth.  From the shower rod hang three pairs of socks on
stretchers.  Bud takes a vial from the medicine shelf,
shakes out a sleeping pill, washes it down with a glass of
water.  He turns the light off, walks into the bedroom.

In the bedroom, the single bed is made, and the lamp on the
night table is on.  Bud plugs in the electric blanket, turns
the dial on.  Then he climbs into bed, props up the pillow
behind him.  From the night table, he picks up the magazine
that arrived in the mail, slides it out of the wrapper,
opens it.  It's the new issue of PLAYBOY.  Bud leafs through
it till he comes to the piece de resistance of the magazine.
He unfolds the overleaf, glances at it casually, refolds it,
then turns to the back of the magazine and starts to read.

What he is so avidly interested in is the men's fashion
section.  There is a layout titled WHAT THE YOUNG EXECUTIVE
WILL WEAR with a sub-head reading The Bowler is Back.
Illustrating the article are several photographs of male
models wearing various styles of bowlers.

Bud is definitely in the market for a bowler, but somehow
his mind starts wandering.  He turns back to the overleaf
again, unfolds it, studies it, then holds the magazine up
vertically to get a different perspective on the subject.
By now the sleeping pill is beginning to take effect, and he
yawns.  He drops the magazine on the floor, kills the light,
settles down to sleep.  The room is dark except for the glow
from the dial of the electric blanket.

Three seconds.  Then the phone jangles shrilly in the living
room.  Bud stumbles groggily out of bed, and putting on his
slippers, makes his way into the living room.  He switches
on the light, picks up the phone.

                         BUD
            Hello? -- Hello? -- yes, this is
            Baxter.

INT. PHONE BOOTH IN A MANHATTAN BAR - NIGHT

On the night is a hearty man of about forty-five, nothing
gut personality, most of it obnoxious.  His name is DOBISCH.

Outside the booth is a blonde babe, slightly boozed, and
beyond there is a suggestion of the packed, smoky joint.

                         DOBISCH
            Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar
            on Sixty-first Street -- and I got
            to thinking about you -- and I
            figured I'd give you a little buzz.

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            Well, that's very nice of you --
            but who is this?

INT. PHONE BOOTH

                         DOBISCH
            Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in
            Administration.

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
                   (snapping to attention)
            Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't
            recognize your voice --

INT. PHONE BOOTH

                         DOBISCH
            That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I
            was saying, I'm in this joint on
            Sixty-first -- and I think I got
            lucky --
                   (glances toward blonde)
            -- she's a skater with the Ice
            Show --
                   (he chuckles)
            -- and I thought maybe I could
            bring her up for a quiet drink.

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I
            like to help you guys out -- but
            it's sort of late -- so why don't
            we make it some other time?

INT. PHONE BOOTH

                         DOBISCH
            Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that
            long -- not even on ice.  Listen,
            kid, I can't pass this up -- she
            looks like Marilyn Monroe.

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            I don't care if it is Marilyn
            Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and
            I've taken a sleeping pill -- so
            I'm afraid the answer is no.

INT. PHONE BOOTH

                         DOBISCH
                   (pulling rank)
            Look, Baxter -- we're making out
            the monthly efficiency rating --
            and I'm putting you in the top ten.
            Now you don't want to louse yourself
            up, do you?

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            Of course not.  But -- how can I be
            efficient in the office if I don't
            get enough sleep at night?

INT. PHONE BOOTH

                         DOBISCH
            It's only eleven -- and I just want
            the place for forty-five minutes.

The blonde opens the door of the phone booth, leans in.

                         BLONDE
            I'm getting lonely.  Who are you
            talking to, anyway?

                         DOBISCH
            My mother.

                         BLONDE
            That's sweet.  That's real sweet.

Dobisch shuts the door in her face.

                         DOBISCH
                   (into phone again)
            Make it thirty minutes.  What do
            you say, Bud?

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
                   (a last stand)
            I'm all out of liquor -- and
            there's no clean glasses -- no
            cheese crackers -- no nothing.

INT. PHONE BOOTH

                         DOBISCH
            Let me worry about that.  Just
            leave the key under the mat and
            clear out.

INT. THE APARTMENT

                         BUD
                   (into phone; resigned)
            Yes, Mr. Dobisch.

He hangs up, shuffles back into the bedroom.

                         BUD
                   (muttering to himself)
            Anything you say, Mr. Dobisch -- no
            trouble at all, Mr. Dobisch -- be
            my guest --

He reappears from the bedroom, pulling his trousers on over
his pajama pants.

                         BUD
            -- We never close at Buddy-boy's --
            looks like Marilyn Monroe --
                   (he chuckles a la Dobisch)


Putting on his raincoat and hat, Bud opens the hall door,
takes the key from the table, shoves it under the doormat.
His eyes fall on the Dreyfuss apartment, and there is some
concern on his face.  He picks up a pad and pencil from the
table, prints something in block letters.  Tearing off the
top sheet, he impales it on the spindle of the phonograph,
then walks out, closing the door behind him.  The note reads:

                        NOT TOO LOUD
                THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING

EXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT

Bud comes out the door, in slippered feet, pants and raincoat
over his pajamas.  As he sleep-walks down the steps, a cab
pulls up in front of the house.  Bud ducks discreetly into
the areaway.  Mr. Dobisch, bareheaded, emerges cautiously
from the cab.  Between the fingers of his hands he is
carrying four long-stemmed glasses, brimful of stingers.
The blonde steps out, holding his hat.

                         BLONDE
            This the place?

                         DOBISCH
            Yeah.
                   (to cab driver)
            How much?

                         CABBIE
            Seventy cents.

Dobisch, his hands full of stingers, turns to the blonde,
indicates his pants pocket.

                         DOBISCH
            Get the money, will you?

The blonde plants the hat on top of his head, unbuttons his
overcoat, reaches into his pants pocket.  As she does so,
she jogs his elbow.

                         DOBISCH
            Watch those stingers!

The blonde has taken out Dobisch's money clip, with about a
hundred dollars in it.

                         DOBISCH
            Give him a buck.

The blonde peels a bill off, hands it to the cabbie, hangs
on to the rest of the roll just a second too long.

                         DOBISCH
            Now put it back, honey.
                   (she does)
            Atta girl.

The cab drives off.  Dobisch and the blonde start up the
steps to the house.

                         BLONDE
            You sure this is a good idea?
                         DOBISCH
            Can't think of a better one.

                         BLONDE
                   (holding door open
                   for him)
            I mean - barging in on your
            mother -- in the middle of the night?

                         DOBISCH
                   (edging past her with stingers)
            Don't worry about the old lady.
            One squawk from her, and she's out
            of a job.

In the areaway, Bud has overheard them, and it doesn't make
him any happier.  He steps out on the sidewalk, shuffles
down the street.

INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

The blonde and Dobisch, his hands full of stingers, come up
to Bud's door.

                         DOBISCH
            Get the key, will you.

Automatically, she reaches into his pocket.

                         DOBISCH
            Not there.  Under the mat.

                         BLONDE
                   (puzzled)
            Under the mat?
                   (picks up key)


                         DOBISCH
                   (impatiently)
            Open up, open up -- we haven't got
            all night.

The blonde unlocks the door to the apartment, opens it.

                         BLONDE
                   (suspiciously)
            So this is your mother's apartment?

                         DOBISCH
            That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya.
                         BLONDE
                   (sticking her head in)
            Hiya, Ouspenskaya.

Dobisch nudges her inside with his knee, kicks the door shut
behind him.

The landing is empty for a second.  Then the door of the
rear apartment opens, and Dr. Dreyfuss, in a beaten bathrobe,
sets out a couple of empty milk bottles with a note in them.
Suddenly, from Bud's apartment, comes a shrill female giggle.
Dr. Dreyfuss reacts.  Then the cha cha music starts full
blast.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (calling to his wife,
                   off-screen)
            Mildred -- he's at it again.

Shaking his head, he closes the door.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

Bud, in raincoat and slippered feet, turns in off the
street, plods along a path in the deserted park.  He stops
at a damp bench under a lamp post, sits.  In the background,
lights shine from the towering buildings on Central Park
South.

Bud huddles inside his raincoat, shivering.  He is very
sleepy by now.  His eyes close and his head droops.  A gust
of wind sends wet leaves swirling across the bench.  Bud
doesn't stir.  He is all in.

                                            FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. LOBBY INSURANCE BUILDING - DAY

It's a quarter to nine of a gray November morning, and work-
bound employees are piling in through the doors.  Among them
is Bud, bundled up in a raincoat, hat, heavy muffler and
wool gloves, and carrying a box of Kleenex.  He coughs,
pulls out a tissue, wipes his dripping nose.  He has a bad
cold.

The lobby is an imposing, marbled affair, as befits a
company which last year wrote 9.3 billion dollars worth of
insurance.  There are sixteen elevators, eight of them
marked LOCAL - FLOORS 1-18, and opposite them eight marked
EXPRESS - FLOORS 18-37.  The starter, a uniformed Valkyrie
wielding a clicker, is directing the flow of traffic into
the various elevators.

Bud joins the crowd in front of one of the express elevators.
Also standing there is Mr. Kirkeby, reading the Herald-
Tribune.

                         BUD
                   (hoarsely)
            Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.

                         KIRKEBY
                   (as if he just knew
                   him vaguely)
            Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They
            keeping you busy these days?

                         BUD
            Yes, sir.  They are indeed.
                   (he sniffs)

The elevator doors open, revealing the operator.  She is in
her middle twenties and her name is FRAN KUBELIK.  Maybe
it's the way she's put together, maybe it's her face, or
maybe it's just the uniform -- in any case, there is
something very appealing about her.  She is also an
individualist -- she wears a carnation in her lapel, which
is strictly against regulations.  As the elevator loads, she
greets the passengers cheerfully.

                         FRAN
                   (rattling it off)
            Morning, Mr. Kessel -- Morning,
            Miss Robinson -- Morning, Mr.
            Kirkeby -- Morning, Mr. Williams --
            Morning, Miss Livingston -- Morning,
            Mr. McKellway -- Morning, Mr.
            Pirelli -- Morning, Mrs. Schubert --

Interspersed is an occasional "Morning, Miss Kubelik" from
the passengers.

                         FRAN
            Morning, Mr. Baxter.

                         BUD
            Morning, Miss Kubelik.

He takes his hat off -- he is the only one.  The express is
now loaded.

                         STARTER
                   (working the clicker)
            That's all.  Take it away.

                         FRAN
                   (shutting the door)
            Watch the door, please.  Blasting
            off.

INT. ELEVATOR

Bud is standing right next to Fran as the packed express
shoots up.

                         BUD
                   (studying her)
            What did you do to your hair?

                         FRAN
            It was making me nervous, so I
            chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?

                         BUD
            I sort of like it.

He sniffs, takes out a Kleenex, wipes his nose.

                         FRAN
            Say, you got a lulu.

                         BUD
            Yeah.  I better not get too close.

                         FRAN
            Oh, I never catch colds.

                         BUD
            Really?  I was looking at some
            figures from the Sickness and
            Accident Claims Division -- do you
            know that the average New Yorker
            between the ages of twenty and
            fifty has two and a half colds a
            year?

                         FRAN
            That makes me feel just terrible.

                         BUD
            Why?

                         FRAN
            Well, to make the figures come out
            even -- since I have no colds a
            year -- some poor slob must have
            five colds a year.

                         BUD
            That's me.
                   (dabs his nose)


                         FRAN
            You should have stayed in bed this
            morning.

                         BUD
            I should have stayed in bed last
            night.

The elevator has slowed down, now stops.  Fran opens the door.

                         FRAN
            Nineteen.  Watch your step.

About a third of the passengers get out, including Bud and
Mr. Kirkeby.  As Kirkeby passes Fran, he slaps her behind
with his folded newspaper.  Fran jumps slightly.

                         FRAN
                   (all in the day's work)
            And watch your hand, Mr. Kirkeby!

                         KIRKEBY
                   (innocently)
            I beg your pardon?

                         FRAN
            One of these days I'm going to shut
            those doors on you and --

She withdraws her hand into the sleeve of her uniform, and
waves the "amputated" arm at him.

                         FRAN
            Twenty next.

The doors close.

INT. NINETEENTH FLOOR - DAY

Kirkeby turns away from the elevator, and grinning smugly,
falls in beside Bud.

                         KIRKEBY
            That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like
            to get her on a slow elevator to
            China.

                         BUD
            Oh, yes.  She's the best operator
            in the building.

                         KIRKEBY
            I'm a pretty good operator myself --
            but she just won't give me a
            tumble -- date-wise.

                         BUD
            Maybe you're using the wrong
            approach.

                         KIRKEBY
            A lot of guys around here have
            tried it -- all kinds of
            approaches -- no dice.  What is she
            trying to prove?

                         BUD
            Could be she's just a nice,
            respectable girl -- there are
            millions of them.

                         KIRKEBY
            Listen to him.  Little Lord
            Fauntleroy!

Leaving Bud at the employees' coat-racks, Kirkeby heads
toward his office, one of the glass-enclosed cubicles.  Bud
hangs up his hat and raincoat, stows away the gloves and
muffler.  Out of his coat pocket he takes a plastic anti-
histamine sprayer and a box of cough drops, and still
carrying the Kleenex, threads his way to his desk.  Most of
the desks are already occupied, and the others are filling
rapidly.

Once seated at his desk, Bud arranges his medicaments neatly
in front of him. He takes a Kleenex out of the box, blows
his nose, then leaning back in his swivel chair sprays first
one nostril, then the other. Suddenly the piercing bell goes
off -- the workday has begun. Being the ultra-conscientious
type, Bud instantly sits upright in his chair, removes the
cover from his computing machine, picks up a batch of
perforated premium cards, starts entering figures on his
computer.

After a few seconds, he glances around to make sure that
everybody in the vicinity is busy. Then he looks up a number
in the company telephone directory, dials furtively.

                         BUD
                   (cupping hand over
                   phone mouthpiece)
            Hello, Mr. Dobisch? This is Baxter,
            on the nineteenth floor.

INT. DOBISCH'S OFFICE - DAY

It is a glass-enclosed cubicle on the twenty-first floor.
Through the glass we see another enormous layout of desks,
everybody working away. Dobisch is holding the phone in one
hand, running an electric shaver over his face with the other.

                         DOBISCH
            Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to
            call you.
                   (shuts off electric shaver)
            I'm sorry about that mess on the
            living room wall. You see, my
            little friend, she kept insisting
            Picasso was a bum -- so she started
            to do that mural -- but I'm sure it
            will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            It's not Picasso I'm calling about.
            It's the key -- to my apartment --
            you were supposed to leave it under
            the mat.

DOBISCH - ON PHONE

                         DOBISCH
            I did, didn't I? I distinctly
            remember bending over and putting
            it there --

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            Oh, I found a key there, all
            right -- only it's the wrong key.

DOBISCH - ON PHONE

                         DOBISCH
            It is?
                   (takes Bud's key out
                   of his pocket)
            Well, how about that? No wonder I
            couldn't get into the executive
            washroom this morning.

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            And I couldn't get into my
            apartment -- so at four a. m. I had
            to wake up the landlady and give
            her a whole song and dance about
            going out to mail a letter and the
            door slamming shut.

DOBISCH - ON PHONE

                         DOBISCH
            That's a shame. I'll send the key
            right down. And about your
            promotion --
                   (leafs through report
                   on desk)
            -- I'm sending that efficiency
            report right up to Mr. Sheldrake,
            in Personnel. I wouldn't be
            surprised if you heard from him
            before the day is over.

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.

He hangs up, feels his forehead. It is warm. Clipped to his
handkerchief pocket are a black fountain pen and, next to
it, a thermometer in a black case. Bud unclips the
thermometer case, unscrews the cap, shakes the thermometer
out, puts it under his tongue. He resumes work.

A messenger comes up to his desk with an interoffice envelope.

                         MESSENGER
            From Mr. Dobisch.

                         BUD
                   (thermometer in mouth)
            Wait.

He turns away from the messenger, unties the string of the
envelope, takes his key out, puts it in a coat pocket. From
a trouser pocket, he extracts Dobisch's key to the executive
washroom, slips it discreetly into the envelope, reties it,
hands it to the messenger.

                         BUD
                   (thermometer in mouth)
            To Mr. Dobisch.

Puzzled by the whole procedure, the messenger leaves. Bud
now removes the thermometer from his mouth, reads it. It's
worse than he thought. He puts the thermometer back in the
case, clips it to his pocket, takes his desk calendar out of
a drawer, turns a leaf. Under the date WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 4
there is an entry in his handwriting -- MR. VANDERHOF. Bud
consults the telephone directory again, picks up the phone,
dials.

INT. VANDERHOF'S OFFICE - DAY

This is another glass-enclosed cubicle on another floor. MR.
VANDERHOF, a Junior Chamber of Commerce type, is dictating
to an elderly secretary who sits across the desk from him.

                         VANDERHOF
            Dear Mr. MacIntosh --
                   (phone rings and he
                   picks it up)
            Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh,
            yes, Baxter. Just a minute.
                   (to secretary)
            All right, Miss Finch -- type up
            what we got so far.
                   (he waits till she is
                   out of the office;
                   then, into phone)
            Now what is it, Baxter?

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you
            down here for tonight -- but I'm
            going to be using the place
            myself -- so I'll have to cancel.

VANDERHOF - ON PHONE

                         VANDERHOF
            Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I
            already ordered the cake --

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            I hate to disappoint you -- I mean,
            many happy returns -- but not
            tonight --

VANDERHOF - ON PHONE

                         VANDERHOF
            That's not like you, Baxter. Just
            the other day, at the staff meeting,
            I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a
            reliable man you were.

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm
            sick -- I have this terrible
            cold -- and a fever -- and I got to
            go to bed right after work.

VANDERHOF - ON PHONE

                         VANDERHOF
            Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing
            you can do. If you got a cold, you
            should go to a Turkish bath --
            spend the night there -- sweat it
            out --

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if
            I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for
            a month -- and if I were in bed for
            a month --

VANDERHOF - ON PHONE

                         VANDERHOF
            Okay, you made your point. We'll
            just have to do it next Wednesday --
            that's the only night of the week I
            can get away.

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            Wednesday -- Wednesday --
                   (leafing through calendar)
            I got somebody penciled in -- let
            me see what I can do -- I'll get
            back to you.

He hangs up, riffles through the directory, finds the
number, and with a furtive look around, dials again.

                         BUD
                   (into phone)
            Mr. Eichelberger? Is this Mortgage
            and Loan? I'd like to speak to Mr.
            Eichelberger. Yes, it is urgent.

INT. EICHELBERGER'S OFFICE - DAY

Also glass-enclosed, but slightly larger than the others. MR.
EICHELBERGER, a solid citizen of about fifty, is displaying
some mortgage graphs to three associates. A fourth one has
answered the phone.

                         ASSOCIATE
                   (holding out phone to Eichelberger)
            For you, Mel.

Eichelberger puts the charts down, takes the phone.

                         EIGHELBERGER
            Eichelberger here -- oh, yes,
            Baxter --
                   (a glance at his
                   associates; then
                   continues, as though
                   it were a business call)
            What's your problem? -- Wednesday
            is out? -- oh -- that throws a
            little monkey wrench into my
            agenda -- Thursday? No, I'm all
            tied up on Thursday -- let's
            schedule that meeting for Friday.

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            Friday?
                   (checks calendar)
            Let me see what I can do. I'll get
            back to you.

He hangs up, consults the directory, starts to dial a number.

INT. KIRKEBY'S OFFICE - DAY

It's another of those glass-enclosed cubicles, on the
nineteenth floor. Kirkeby is talking into a dictaphone.

                         KIRKEBY
            Premium-wise and billing-wise, we
            are eighteen percent ahead of last
            year, October-wise.

The phone has been ringing. Kirkeby switches off the machine,
picks up the phone.

                         KIRKEBY
            Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            Instead of Friday -- could you
            possibly switch to Thursday? You'd
            be doing me a great favor --

KIRKEBY - ON PHONE

                         KIRKEBY
            Well -- it's all right with me, Bud.
            Let me check. I'll get back to you.

He presses down the button on the cradle, dials Operator.

INT. SWITCHBOARD ROOM

There is a double switchboard in the center, with nine girls
on each side, all busy as beavers. In the foreground we
recognize Sylvia, Kirkeby's date of last night.

                         SYLVIA
            Consolidated Life -- I'll connect
            you -- Consolidated Life --

The girl next to her turns and holds out a line.

                         SWITCHBOARD GIRL
            Sylvia -- it's for you.

Sylvia plugs the call into her own switchboard.

                         SYLVIA
            Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home
            all right -- you owe me forty-five
            cents.

KIRKEBY - ON PHONE

                         KIRKEBY
            Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead
            of Friday - could we make it
            Thursday night?

SYLVIA - AT SWITCHBOARD

                         SYLVIA
            Thursday? That's The Untouchables --
            with Bob Stack.

KIRKEBY - ON PHONE

                         KIRKEBY
            Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll
            watch it at the apartment. Big deal.
                   (he hangs up, dials)
            Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.

INT. NINETEENTH FLOOR - DAY

Bud, at his desk, is on the phone.

                         BUD
            Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
                   (hangs up, consults
                   directory, dials)
            Mr. Eichelberger? It's okay for
            Friday.
                   (hangs up, consults
                   directory, dials)
            Mr. Vanderhof? It's okay for
            Wednesday.

During this, the phone has rung at the next desk, and the
occupant, MR. MOFFETT, has picked it up. As Bud hangs up --

                         MOFFETT
                   (into phone)
            All right -- I'll tell him.
                   (hangs up, turns to Bud)
            Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel.
            Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

                         BUD
            Sheldrake?

                         MOFFETT
            She's been trying to reach you for
            the last twenty minutes. They want
            you up stairs.

                         BUD
            Oh!

He jumps up, stuffs the nose-spray into one pocket, a
handful of Kleenex into the other.

                         MOFFETT
            What gives, Baxter? You getting
            promoted or getting fired?

                         BUD
                   (cockily)
            Care to make a small wager?

                         MOFFETT
            I've been here twice as long as you
            have --

                         BUD
            Shall we say -- a dollar?

                         MOFFETT
            It's a bet.

Bud snake-hips between the desks like a broken-field runner.

At the elevator, Bud presses the UP button, paces nervously.
One of the elevator doors opens, and as Bud starts inside,
the doors of the adjoining elevator open, and Fran Kubelik
sticks her head out.

                         FRAN
            Going up?

Hearing her voice, Bud throws a quick "Excuse me" to the
other operator, exits quickly and steps into Fran's elevator.

                         BUD
            Twenty-seven, please. And drive
            carefully. You're carrying precious
            cargo -- I mean, manpower-wise.

Fran shuts the doors.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Fran presses a button, and the elevator starts up.

                         FRAN
            Twenty-seven.

                         BUD
            You may not realize it, Miss
            Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten --
            efficiency-wise and this may be the
            day -- promotion-wise.

                         FRAN
            You're beginning to sound like Mr.
            Kirkeby already.

                         BUD
            Why not? Now that they're kicking
            me upstairs --

                         FRAN
            Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
                   (Bud beams)
            You know, you're the only one
            around here who ever takes his hat
            off in the elevator.

                         BUD
            Really?

                         FRAN
            The characters you meet. Something
            happens to men in elevators. Must
            be the change of altitude -- the
            blood rushes to their head, or
            something -- boy, I could tell you
            stories --

                         BUD
            I'd love to hear them. Maybe we
            could have lunch in the cafeteria
            sometime -- or some evening, after
            work --

The elevator has stopped, and Fran opens the doors.

                         FRAN
            Twenty-seven.

INT. TWENTY-SEVENTH FLOOR FOYER - DAY

It is pretty plush up here -- soft carpeting and tall
mahogany doors leading to the executive offices. The elevator
door is open, and Bud steps out.

                         FRAN
            I hope everything goes all right.

                         BUD
            I hope so.
                   (turning back)
            Wouldn't you know they'd call me on
            a day like this -- with my cold and
            everything --
                   (fumbling with his tie)
            How do I look?

                         FRAN
            Fine.
                   (stepping out of elevator)
            Wait.

She takes the carnation out of her lapel, starts to put it
in Bud's buttonhole.

                         BUD
            Thank you. That's the first thing I
            ever noticed about you -- when you
            were still on the local elevator --
            you always wore a flower --

The elevator buzzer is now sounding insistently.  Fran steps
back inside.

                         FRAN
            Good luck. And wipe your nose.

She shuts the doors. Bud looks after her, then takes a
Kleenex out of his pocket, and wiping his nose, crosses to a
glass door marked J. D. SHELDRAKE, DIRECTOR OF PERSONNEL. He
stashes the used Kleenex away in another pocket, enters.

INT. SHELDRAKE'S ANTEROOM - DAY

It is a sedate office with a secretary and a couple of
typists. The secretary's name is MISS OLSEN. She is in her
thirties, flaxen- haired, handsome, wears harlequin glasses,
and has an incisive manner. Bud comes up to her desk.

                         BUD
            C. C. Baxter -- Ordinary Premium
            Accounting -- Mr. Sheldrake called
            me.

                         MISS OLSEN
            I called you -- that is, I tried to
            call you -- for twenty minutes.

                         BUD
            I'm sorry, I --

                         MISS OLSEN
            Go on in.

She indicates the door leading to the inner office. Bud
squares his shoulders and starts in.

INT. SHELDRAKE'S OFFICE - DAY

Mr. Sheldrake is a $14,000 a year man, and rates a four-
window office.

It is not quite an executive suite, but it is several pegs
above the glass cubicles of the middle echelon. There is
lots of leather, and a large desk behind which sits MR.
SHELDRAKE. He is a substantial looking, authoritative man in
his middle forties, a pillar of his suburban community, a
blood donor and a family man. The latter is attested to by a
framed photograph showing two boys, aged 8 and 10, in
military school uniforms.

As Baxter comes through the door, Sheldrake is leafing
through Dobisch's efficiency report. He looks up at Bud
through a pair of heavy-rimmed reading glasses.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Baxter?

                         BUD
            Yes, sir.

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (studying him)
            I was sort of wondering what you
            looked like. Sit down.

                         BUD
            Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

He seats himself on the very edge of the leather armchair
facing Sheldrake.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Been hearing some very nice things
            about you -- here's a report from
            Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative,
            resourceful --

                         BUD
            Mr. Dobisch said that?

                         SHELDRAKE
            And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that
            several nights a week you work late
            at the office -- without overtime.

                         BUD
                   (modestly)
            Well, you know how it is -- things
            pile up.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations,
            and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage
            and Loan -- they'd both like to
            have you transferred to their
            departments.

                         BUD
            That's very flattering.

Sheldrake puts the report down, takes off his glasses, leans
across the desk toward Bud.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it
            that makes you so popular?

                         BUD
            I don't know.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Think.

Bud does so. For a moment, he is a picture of intense
concentration. Then --

                         BUD
            Would you mind repeating the
            question?

                         SHELDRAKE
            Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I
            know everything that goes on in
            this building -- in every
            department -- on every floor --
            every day of the year.

                         BUD
                   (in a very small voice)
            You do?

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (rises, starts pacing)
            In 1957, we had an employee here,
            name of Fowler. He was very popular,
            too. Turned out he was running a
            bookie joint right in the Actuarial
            Department tying up the switchboard,
            figuring the odds on our I.B.M.
            machines -- so the day before the
            Kentucky Derby, I called in the
            Vice Squad and we raided the
            thirteenth floor.

                         BUD
                   (worried)
            The Vice Squad?

                         SHELDRAKE
            That's right, Baxter.

                         BUD
            What -- what's that got to do with
            me? I'm not running any bookie joint.

                         SHELDRAKE
            What kind of joint are you running?

                         BUD
            Sir?

                         SHELDRAKE
            There's a certain key floating
            around the office -- from Kirkeby
            to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to
            Dobisch -- it's the key to a
            certain apartment -- and you know
            who that apartment belongs to?

                         BUD
            Who?

                         SHELDRAKE
            Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C.
            C. Baxter.

                         BUD
            Oh.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Are you going to deny it?

                         BUD
            No, sir. I'm not going to deny it.
            But if you'd just let me explain --

                         SHELDRAKE
            You better.

                         BUD
                   (a deep breath)
            Well, about six months ago -- I was
            going to night school, taking this
            course in Advanced Accounting --
            and one of the guys in our
            department -- he lives in Jersey --
            he was going to a banquet at the
            Biltmore -- his wife was meeting
            him in town, and he needed someplace
            to change into a tuxedo -- so I
            gave him the key    and word must
            have gotten around -- because the
            next thing I knew, all sorts of
            guys were suddenly going to
            banquets -- and when you give the
            key to one guy, you can't say no to
            another and the whole thing got out
            of hand -- pardon me.

He whips out the nasal-spray, administers a couple of quick
squirts up each nostril.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Baxter, an insurance company is
            founded on public trust. Any
            employee who conducts himself in a
            manner unbecoming --
                   (shifting into a new gear)
            How many charter members are there
            in this little club of yours?

                         BUD
            Just those four -- out of a total
            of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be
            very proud of our personnel --
            percentage-wise.

                         SHELDRAKE
            That's not the point. Four rotten
            apples in a barrel -- no matter how
            large the barrel -- you realize
            that if this ever leaked out --

                         BUD
            Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's
            not going to happen again. From now
            on, nobody is going to use my
            apartment --

In his vehemence he squeezes the spray bottle, which squirts
all over the desk.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Where is your apartment?

                         BUD
            West 67th Street. You have no idea
            what I've been going through --
            with the neighbors and the landlady
            and the liquor and the key --

                         SHELDRAKE
            How do you work it with the key?

                         BUD
            Well, usually I slip it to them in
            the office and they leave it under
            the mat -- but never again -- I can
            promise you that --

The phone buzzer sounds, and Sheldrake picks up the phone.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Yes, Miss Olsen.

INT. SHELDRAKE'S ANTEROOM - DAY

Miss Olsen is on the phone.

                         MISS OLSEN
            Mrs. Sheldrake returning your
            call -- on two --

She presses a button down, starts to hang the phone up,
glances around to see if the typists are watching, then
raises the receiver to her ear and eavesdrops on the
conversation.

INT. SHELDRAKE'S OFFICE - DAY

Sheldrake is talking into the phone.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Yes, dear -- I called you earlier --
            where were you? Oh, you took Tommy
            to the dentist --

During this, Bud has risen from his chair, started inching
toward the door.

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (turning to him)
            Where are you going, Baxter?

                         BUD
            Well, I don't want to intrude --
            and I thought -- since it's all
            straightened out anyway --

                         SHELDRAKE
            I'm not through with you yet.

                         BUD
            Yes, sir.

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (into phone)
            The reason I called is -- I won't
            be home for dinner tonight. The
            branch manager from Kansas City is
            in town -- I'm taking him to the
            theatre Music Man, what else? No,
            don't wait up for me -- 'bye,
            darling.
                   (hangs up, turns to Bud)
            Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have
            you seen Music Man?

                         BUD
            Not yet. But I hear it's one swell
            show.

                         SHELDRAKE
            How would you like to go tonight?

                         BUD
            You mean -- you and me? I thought
            you were taking the branch manager
            from Kansas City --

                         SHELDRAKE
            I made other plans. You can have
            both tickets.

                         BUD
            Well, that's very kind of you --
            only I'm not feeling well -- you
            see, I have this cold -- and I
            thought I'd go straight home.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Baxter, you're not reading me. I
            told you I have plans.

                         BUD
            So do I -- I'm going to take four
            aspirins and get into bed -- so you
            better give the tickets to somebody
            else --

                         SHELDRAKE
            I'm not just giving those tickets,
            Baxter -- I want to swap them.

                         BUD
            Swap them? For what?

Sheldrake picks up the Dobisch reports, puts on his glasses,
turns a page.

                         SHELDRAKE
            It also says here -- that you are
            alert, astute, and quite
            imaginative --

                         BUD
            Oh?
                   (the dawn is breaking)
            Oh!

He reaches into his coat pocket, fishes out a handful of
Kleenex, and then finally the key to his apartment. He holds
it up.

                         BUD
            This?

                         SHELDRAKE
            That's good thinking, Baxter. Next
            month there's going to be a shift
            in personnel around here -- and as
            far as I'm concerned, you're
            executive material.

                         BUD
            I am?

                         SHELDRAKE
            Now put down the key --
                   (pushing a pad toward him)
            -- and put down the address.

Bud lays the key on the desk, unclips what he thinks is his
fountain pen, uncaps it, starts writing on the pad.

                         BUD
            It's on the second floor - my name
            is not on the door -- it just says
            2A --

Suddenly he realizes that he has been trying to write the
address with the thermometer.

                         BUD
            Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that
            cold --

                         SHELDRAKE
            Relax, Baxter.

                         BUD
            Thank you, sir.

He has replaced the thermometer with the fountain pen, and
is scribbling the address.

                         BUD
            You'll be careful with the record
            player, won't you? And about the
            liquor -- I ordered some this
            morning -- but I'm not sure when
            they'll deliver it --

He has finished writing the address, shoves the pad over to
Sheldrake.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Now remember, Baxter -- this is
            going to be our little secret.

                         BUD
            Yes, of course.

                         SHELDRAKE
            You know how people talk.

                         BUD
            Oh, you don't have to worry --

                         SHELDRAKE
            Not that I have anything to hide.

                         BUD
            Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway,
            it's none of my business -- four
            apples, five apples -- what's the
            difference -- percentage-wise?

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (holding out the tickets)
            Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice
            time.

                         BUD
            You too, sir.

Clutching the tickets, he backs out of the office.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LOBBY INSURANCE BUILDING - EVENING

It is about 6:30, and the building has pretty well emptied
out by now. Bud, in raincoat and hat, is leaning against one
of the marble pillars beyond the elevators. His raincoat is
unbuttoned, and Fran's carnation is still in his lapel. He
is looking off expectantly toward a door marked EMPLOYEES'
LOUNGE - WOMEN.

Some of the female employees are emerging, dressed for the
street. Among them are Sylvia and her colleague from the
switchboard.

                         SYLVIA
            So I figure, a man in his position,
            he's going to take me to 21 and El
            Morocco -- instead, he takes me to
            Hamburg Heaven and some schnook's
            apartment --

They pass Bud without paying any attention to him. Bud has
heard the crack, and looks after Sylvia, a little hurt. Then
he glances back toward the door of the lounge, as it opens
and Fran Kubelik comes out. She is wearing a wool coat over
a street dress, no hat.

                         FRAN
                   (passing Bud)
            Good night.

                         BUD
                   (casually)
            Good night.

She is about three paces beyond him when he suddenly realizes
who it is.

                         BUD
            Oh -- Miss Kubelik.
                   (he rushes after her,
                   taking off his hat)
            I've been waiting for you.
                         FRAN
            You have?

                         BUD
            I almost didn't recognize you --
            this is the first time I've ever
            seen you in civilian clothes.

                         FRAN
            How'd you make out on the twenty-
            seventh floor?

                         BUD
            Great. Look -- have you seen The
            Music Man?

                         FRAN
            No.

                         BUD
            Would you like to?

                         FRAN
            Sure.

                         BUD
            I thought maybe we could have a
            bite to eat first -- and then --

                         FRAN
            You mean tonight?

                         BUD
            Yeah.

                         FRAN
            I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm
            meeting somebody.

                         BUD
            Oh.
                   (a beat)
            You mean -- like a girl-friend?

                         FRAN
            No. Like a man.

She proceeds across the lobby toward the street entrance,
Bud following her.

                         BUD
            I wasn't trying to be personal --
            it's just that the fellows in the
            office were -- whether you wondering
            about you ever --

                         FRAN
            Just tell 'em -- now and then.

                         BUD
            This date -- is it just a date --
            or is it something serious?

                         FRAN
            It used to be serious -- at least I
            was -- but he wasn't -- so the
            whole thing is more or less kaputt.

                         BUD
            Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?

                         FRAN
            I'm afraid not. I promised to have
            a drink with him -- he's been
            calling me all week --

                         BUD
            Oh, I understand.

He follows her out through the revolving doors.

EXT. INSURANCE BUILDING - EVENING

Fran and Bud come out.

                         BUD
                   (putting his hat on)
            Well, it was just an idea -- I hate
            to see a ticket go to waste --

                         FRAN
                   (stops)
            What time does the show go on?

                         BUD
            Eight-thirty.

                         FRAN
                   (looks at her watch)
            Well -- I could meet you at the
            theatre -- if that's all right.

                         BUD
            All right? That's wonderful! It's
            the Majestic -- 44th Street.

                         FRAN
            Meet you in the lobby. Okay?

Bud nods happily, falls in beside her as she starts down the
street.

                         BUD
            You know, I felt so lousy this
            morning -- a hundred and one
            fever -- then my promotion came
            up -- now you and I -- eleventh row
            center -- and you said I should
            have stayed in bed.

                         FRAN
            How is your cold?

                         BUD
                   (high as a kite)
            What cold? And after the show, we
            could go out on the town --
                   (does a little cha
                   cha step)
            I've been taking from Arthur Murray.

                         FRAN
            So I see.

                         BUD
            They got a great little band at El
            Chico, in the Village -- it's
            practically around the corner from
            where you live.

                         FRAN
            Sounds good.
                   (a sudden thought)
            How do you know where I live?

                         BUD
            Oh, I even know who you live
            with -- your sister and brother-in-
            law -- I know when you were born --
            and where -- I know all sorts of
            things about you.

                         FRAN
            How come?

                         BUD
            A couple of months ago I looked up
            your card in the group insurance
            file.

                         FRAN
            Oh.

                         BUD
            I know your height, your weight and
            your Social Security number -- you
            had mumps, you had measles, and you
            had your appendix out.

They have now reached the corner, and Fran stops.

                         FRAN
            Well, don't tell the fellows in the
            office about the appendix. They may
            get the wrong idea how you found
            out.
                   (turning the corner)
            'Bye.

                         BUD
                   (calling after her)
            Eight-thirty!

He watches her walk away, an idiot grin on his face. Despite
what he told Fran, his nose is stuffed up, so he takes out
the anti-histamine and sprays his nostrils. Then, carried
away, he squirts some of the stuff on the carnation in his
buttonhole, moves off in the opposite direction.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - EVENING

Fran comes hurrying along the street. She is late. Her
objective is a small Chinese restaurant, with a neon sign
reading THE RICKSHAW - COCKTAILS - CANTONESE FOOD. She
starts down a flight of steps leading to the entrance.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - EVENING

The bar is a long, narrow, dimly-lit room with booths along
one side. Beyond a bamboo curtain is the main dining room,
which does not concern us. The place is decorated in Early
Beachcomber style rattan, fish-nets, conch-shells, etc.

The help is Chinese. At this early hour, there are only half
a dozen customers in the place -- all at the bar except for
one man, sitting in the last booth with his back toward
camera. At a piano, a Chinese member of Local 808 is
improvising mood music.

Fran comes through the door, and without looking around,
heads straight for the last booth. The bartender nods to
her -- they know her there. As she passes the piano player,
he gives her a big smile, segues into JEALOUS LOVER.

Fran comes up to the man sitting in the last booth.

                         FRAN
                   (a wistful smile)
            Good evening, Mr. Sheldrake.

Sheldrake, for that's who it is, looks around nervously to
make sure no one has heard her.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Please, Fran -- not so loud.
                   (he gets up)


                         FRAN
            Still afraid somebody may see us
            together?

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (reaching for her coat)
            Let me take that.

                         FRAN
            No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.
                   (sits opposite him,
                   with her coat on)
            Can I have a frozen daiquiri?

                         SHELDRAKE
            It's on the way.
                   (sits down)
            I see you went ahead and cut your
            hair.

                         FRAN
            That's right.

                         SHELDRAKE
            You know I liked it better long.

                         FRAN
            Yes, I know. You want a lock to
            carry in your wallet?

A waiter comes up with a tray: two daiquiris, fried shrimp,
eggrolls, and a bowl of sauce.

                         WAITER
                   (showing all his teeth)
            Evening, lady. Nice see you again.

                         FRAN
            Thank you.

The waiter has set everything on the table, leaves.

                         SHELDRAKE
            How long has it been -- a month?

                         FRAN
            Six weeks. But who's counting?

                         SHELDRAKE
            I missed you, Fran.

                         FRAN
            Like old times. Same booth, same
            song --

                         SHELDRAKE
            It's been hell.

                         FRAN
                   (dipping shrimp)
            -- same sauce -- sweet and sour.

                         SHELDRAKE
            You don't know what it's like --
            standing next to you in that
            elevator, day after day -- Good
            morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good
            night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still
            crazy about you, Fran.

                         FRAN
                   (avoiding his eyes)
            Let's not start on that again,
            Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning
            to get over it.

                         SHELDRAKE
            I don't believe you.

                         FRAN
            Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful
            months this summer -- and that was
            it. Happens all the time -- the
            wife and kids go away to the
            country, and the boss has a fling
            with the secretary or the
            manicurist -- or the elevator girl.
            Comes September, the picnic is
            over -- goodbye. The kids go back
            to school, the boss goes back to
            the wife, and the girl --
                   (she is barely able
                   to control herself)
            They don't make these shrimp like
            they used to.

                         SHELDRAKE
            I never said goodbye, Fran.

                         FRAN
                   (not listening)
            For a while there, you try kidding
            yourself that you're going with an
            unmarried man. Then one day he
            keeps looking at his watch, and
            asks you if there's any lipstick
            showing, then rushes off to catch
            the seven-fourteen to White Plains.
            So you fix yourself a cup of
            instant coffee -- and you sit there
            by yourself -- and you think -- and
            it all begins to look so ugly --

There are tears in her eyes. She breaks off, downs what's
left of the daiquiri.

                         SHELDRAKE
            How do you think I felt -- riding
            home on that seven-fourteen train?

                         FRAN
            Why do you keep calling me, Jeff?
            What do you want from me?

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (taking her hand)
            I want you back, Fran.

                         FRAN
                   (withdrawing her hand)
            Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up.
            You'll have to take the next
            elevator.

                         SHELDRAKE
            You're not giving me a chance, Fran.
            I asked you to meet me because -- I
            have something to tell you.
                         FRAN
            Go ahead -- tell me.

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (a glance around)
            Not here, Fran. Can't we go some
            place else?

                         FRAN
            No. I have a date at eight-thirty.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Important?

                         FRAN
            Not very -- but I'm going to be
            there anyway.

She takes out an inexpensive square compact with a fleur de
lis pattern on it, opens it, starts to fix her face. The
waiter comes up with a couple of menus.

                         WAITER
            You ready order dinner now?

                         FRAN
            No. No dinner.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Bring us two more drinks.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. MAJESTIC THEATRE - EVENING

It is 8:25, and there is the usual hectic to-do -- taxis
pulling up, people milling around the sidewalk and crowding
into the lobby. In the middle of this melee, buffeted by the
throng, stands Bud, in raincoat and hat, looking anxiously
for Fran.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - EVENING

Fran and Sheldrake, in the booth, are working on the second
round of drinks.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Fran -- remember that last weekend
            we had?

                         FRAN
                   (wryly)
            Do I. That leaky little boat you
            rented -- and me in a black negligee
            and a life preserver --

                         SHELDRAKE
            Remember what we talked about?

                         FRAN
            We talked about a lot of things.

                         SHELDRAKE
            I mean -- about my getting a divorce.

                         FRAN
            We didn't talk about it -- you did.

                         SHELDRAKE
            You didn't really believe me, did
            you?

                         FRAN
                   (shrugging)
            They got it an a long playing
            record now - Music to String Her
            Along By. My wife doesn't understand
            me -- We haven't gotten along for
            years -- You're the best thing that
            ever happened to me --

                         SHELDRAKE
            That's enough, Fran.

                         FRAN
                   (going right on)
            Just trust me, baby -- we'll work
            it out somehow --

                         SHELDRAKE
            You're not being funny.

                         FRAN
            I wasn't trying.

                         SHELDRAKE
            If you'll just listen to me for a
            minute --

                         FRAN
            Okay. I'm sorry.

                         SHELDRAKE
            I saw my lawyer this morning -- I
            wanted his advice  -- about the
            best way to handle it --

                         FRAN
            Handle what?

                         SHELDRAKE
            What do you think?

                         FRAN
                   (looking at him for a
                   long moment - then)
            Let's get something straight,
            Jeff -- I never asked you to leave
            your wife.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Of course not. You had nothing to
            do with it.

                         FRAN
                   (her eyes misting up again)
            Are you sure that's what you want?

                         SHELDRAKE
            I'm sure. If you'll just tell me
            that you still love me --

                         FRAN
                   (softly)
            You know I do.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Fran --

He takes her hand, kisses it. The bar has been filling up,
and now two couples are seating themselves in a nearby booth.
One of the women is Miss Olsen.

                         FRAN
                   (pulling her hand
                   away gently)
            Jeff -- darling --

She indicates the other customers. Sheldrake glances over
his shoulder.

                         SHELDRAKE
            It is crowding up. Let's get out of
            here.

They rise. Sheldrake leaves some money on the table, leads
Fran toward the entrance. As they pass Miss Olsen's booth,
she turns around slowly, and putting on her glasses, looks
after them.

Sheldrake slips a bill to the piano player, who gives them a
big smile, slides into JEALOUS LOVER again. Retrieving his
hat and coat from the checkroom girl, Sheldrake steers Fran
through the door.

Miss Olsen watches them with a cold smile.

EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - EVENING

Fran and Sheldrake come up the steps.

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (to a passing cab)
            Taxi!

It passes without stopping.

                         FRAN
            I have that date -- remember?

                         SHELDRAKE
            I love you -- remember?

Another taxi approaches. Sheldrake gives a shrill whistle,
and it pulls up. He opens the door.

                         FRAN
            Where are we going, Jeff? Not back
            to that leaky boat --

                         SHELDRAKE
            I promise.

He helps her into the cab, takes out of his coat pocket the
page from the pad on which Bud wrote the address of the
apartment.

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (to cab driver)
            51 West Sixty-Seventh.

He gets in beside Fran, shuts the door. As the cab pulls
away, through the rear window the two can be seen kissing.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. MAJESTIC THEATRE - EVENING

It's 9 o'clock, the lobby is deserted, and standing on the
sidewalk all by himself, is Bud. He takes a Kleenex out of
his pocket, blows his nose, stuffs the used Kleenex in
another pocket. He looks up and down the street, consults
his watch, decides to wait just a little longer.

                                            FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

BAXTER'S DESK CALENDAR

The leaves are flipping over. Mr. Sheldrake seems to be
using The Apartment regularly -- for the name Sheldrake, in
Bud's handwriting, appears on the pages dated Monday,
November 9, Thursday, November 12, Thursday, November 19,
Monday, November 23, and Monday, November 30. Mr. Sheldrake
also seems to be Baxter's only customer by now, since the
other leaves of the calendar are blank.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. NINETEENTH FLOOR - INSURANCE BUILDING - DAY

It is a gloomy December morning, and hundreds of desk-bound
employees are bent over their paper-work.

Bud Baxter, in raincoat and hat, is clearing out his desk.
He has piled everything on his blotter pad -- reference
books, papers, a fountain pen set, pencils, paper clips and
the calendar. Watching him from the next desk is a
dumbfounded Moffett. Bud picks up the blotter pad with his
stuff on it, and as he moves past Moffett's desk, Moffett
takes out a dollar bill, drops it grudgingly on the loaded
pad. Bud flashes him a little grin, continues between the
desks toward the row of glass-enclosed offices housing the
supervisory personnel.

He comes up to an unoccupied cubicle. A sign painter is
brushing in some new lettering on the glass door -- it reads
C. C. BAXTER, Second Administrative Assistant. Bud studies
the sign with a good deal of satisfaction.

                         BUD
                   (to painter)
            Would you mind --?
                   (the painter turns around)
            C. C. Baxter -- that's me.

With an "Oh, " the painter opens the door for him.

INT. BAXTER'S OFFICE - DAY

Bud enters his new office, deposits his stuff on the bare
desk, looks around possessively. The small cubicle boasts
one window, carpeting on the floor, a filing cabinet, a
couple of synthetic-leather chairs, and a clothes-tree -- to
Bud, it is the Taj Mahal. He crosses to the clothes-tree,
removes his hat and coat, hangs them up. From OFF comes --

                         KIRKEBY'S VOICE
            Hi, Buddy-boy.

                         DOBISCH'S VOICE
            Congratulations, and all that jazz.

Bud turns. Kirkeby, Dobisch, Eichelberger and Vanderhof have
come into the office.

                         BUD
            Hi, fellas.

                         EICHELBERGER
            Well, you made it, kid -- just like
            we promised.

                         VANDERHOF
            Quite an office -- name on the
            door -- rug on the floor -- the
            whole schmear.

                         BUD
            Yeah.

                         DOBISCH
            Teamwork -- that's what counts in
            an organization like this. All for
            one and one for all -- know what I
            mean?

                         BUD
            I have a vague idea.

Kirkeby signals to Vanderhof, who shuts the door. The four
charter members of the club start closing in on Bud.

                         KIRKEBY
            Baxter, we're a little disappointed
            in you -- gratitude-wise.

                         BUD
            Oh, I'm very grateful.

                         EIGHELBERGER
            Then why are you locking us out,
            all of a sudden?

                         BUD
            It's been sort of rough these last
            few weeks -- what with my cold and
            like that --

He has picked up the desk calendar, shoves it discreetly
into one of the drawers.

                         DOBISCH
            We went to bat for you -- and now
            you won't play ball with us.

                         BUD
            Well, after all, it's my
            apartment -- it's private
            property -- it's not a public
            playground.

                         VANDERHOF
            All right, so you got yourself a
            girl -- that's okay with us -- but
            not every night of the week.

                         KIRKEBY
            How selfish can you get?
                   (to the others)
            Last week I had to borrow my
            nephew's car and take Sylvia to a
            drive-in in Jersey. I'm too old for
            that sort of thing -- I mean, in a
            Volkswagen.

                         BUD
            I sympathize with your problem --
            and believe me, I'm very sorry --

                         DOBISCH
            You'll be a lot sorrier before
            we're through with you.

                         BUD
            You threatening me?

                         DOBISCH
            Listen, Baxter, we made you and we
            can break you.

He deliberately flips a cigar ash on Bud's desk. At the same
time, the door opens, and Sheldrake comes striding in briskly.

                         BUD
            Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.

The others swivel around.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Morning, gentlemen.
                   (to Bud)
            Everything satisfactory? You like
            your office?

                         BUD
            Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want
            to thank you --

                         SHELDRAKE
            Don't thank me -- thank your
            friends here -- they're the ones
            who recommended you.

The four friends manage to work up some sickly smiles.

                         DOBISCH
            We just dropped in to wish him the
            best.
                   (quickly brushes
                   cigar ash off desk)


                         KIRKEBY
                   (as they move toward
                   the door)
            So long, Baxter. We know you won't
            let us down.

                         BUD
            So long, fellas. Drop in any time.
            The door is always open -- to my
            office.

They leave. Sheldrake and Bud are alone.

                         SHELDRAKE
            I like the way you handled that.
            Well, how does it feel to be an
            executive?

                         BUD
            Fine. And I want you to know I'll
            work very hard to justify your
            confidence in me --
                         SHELDRAKE
            Sure you will.
                   (a beat)
            Say, Baxter, about the apartment -
            now that you got a raise, don't you
            think we can afford a second key?

                         BUD
            Well -- I guess so.

                         SHELDRAKE
            You know my secretary -- Miss
            Olsen --

                         BUD
            Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she --
            the lucky one?

                         SHELDRAKE
            No, you don't understand. She's a
            busybody -- always poking her nose
            into things -- and with that key
            passing back and forth -- why take
            chances?

                         BUD
            Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.

He glances toward the glass partitions to make sure that
nobody is watching.

                         BUD
            I have something here -- I think it
            belongs to you.

Out of his pocket he has slipped the compact with the fleur-
de-lis pattern we saw Fran use at the Rickshaw. He holds it
out to Sheldrake.

                         SHELDRAKE
            To me?

                         BUD
            I mean -- the young lady -- whoever
            she may be -- it was on the couch
            when I got home last night.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Oh, yes. Thanks.

                         BUD
            The mirror is broken.
                   (opens compact,
                   revealing crack in mirror)
            It was broken when I found it.

                         SHELDRAKE
            So it was.
                   (takes the compact)
            She threw it at me.

                         BUD
            Sir?

                         SHELDRAKE
            You know how it is -- sooner or
            later they all give you a bad time.

                         BUD
                   (man-of-the-world)
            I know how it is.

                         SHELDRAKE
            You see a girl a couple of times a
            week -- just for laughs -- and
            right away she thinks you're going
            to divorce your wife. I ask you --
            is that fair?

                         BUD
            No, sir. That's very unfair --
            especially to your wife.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Yeah.
                   (shifting gears)
            You know, Baxter, I envy you.
            Bachelor -- all the dames you
            want -- no headaches, no
            complications --

                         BUD
            Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Put me down for Thursday again.

                         BUD
            Roger. And I'll get that other key.

Sheldrake exits. Bud takes the calendar out of the desk
drawer, makes an entry.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

BAXTER'S DESK CALENDAR

Again the leaves are flipping over, and again we see
Sheldrake's name in Bud's handwriting -- booked for the
following dates: Monday, December 14, Thursday, December 17,
Monday, December 21, Thursday, December 24.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY

Perched on top of the switchboard is a small decorated
Christmas tree, and the operators are dispensing holiday
greetings to all callers.

                         OPERATORS
            Consolidated Life -- Merry
            Christmas -- I'll connect you --
            Consolidated Life -- Merry
            Christmas -- I'm ringing --

In the foreground, Sylvia is engaged in a private
conversation of her own.

                         SYLVIA
                   (into mouthpiece)
            Yeah? -- YEAH? -- Where? -- You
            bet --

She tears off her headset, and turns to the other girls.

                         SYLVIA
            Somebody watch my line -- there's a
            swinging party up on the nineteenth
            floor --

She scoots out the door. The other girls immediately abandon
their posts, and dash after her.

INT. NINETEENTH FLOOR - DAY

It's a swinging party, all right. Nobody is working. Several
desks have been cleared and pushed together, and on top of
this improvised stage four female employees and Mr. Dobisch,
with his pants-legs rolled up, are doing a Rockette kick
routine to the tune of JINGLE BELLS. Employees are ringed
around the performers, some drinking out of paper cups,
others singing and clapping in rhythm.

One of the cubicles has been transformed into a bar, and it
is jammed with people. Mr. Kirkeby and Mr. Vanderhof are
pouring -- each has a couple of bottles of liquor in his
hands, and is emptying them into the open top of a water-
cooler.

But the stuff is flowing out as fast as it flows in --
everybody is in line with a paper cup waiting for a refill.

Bud comes shouldering his way out of the crowded cubicle,
holding aloft two paper cups filled with booze. Since his
promotion he has bought himself a new suit, dark flannel,
and with it he wears a white shirt with a pinned round
collar, and a foulard tie. He also has quite a glow on.
Detouring past necking couples, he heads in the direction of
the elevators.

The doors of Fran's elevator are just opening, and the
switchboard operators, led by Sylvia, come streaming out.

                         SYLVIA
                   (to a colleague)
            -- so I said to him: Never again! --
            either get yourself a bigger car or
            a smaller girl --

As they head for the party, they pass Bud, who is approaching
the elevator with the two drinks. Fran is just closing the
elevator doors.

                         BUD
            Miss Kubelik.

The doors slide open again, and Fran looks out. Instead of
the customary carnation in the lapel of her uniform, she
wears a sprig of holly.

                         BUD
                   (holding out one of
                   the drinks)
            Marry Christmas.

                         FRAN
            Thank you.
                   (takes drink)
            I thought you were avoiding me.

                         BUD
            What gave you that idea?

                         FRAN
            In the last six weeks you've only
            been in my elevator once -- and
            then you didn't take your hat off.

                         BUD
            Well, as a matter of fact, I was
            rather hurt when you stood me up
            that night --

                         FRAN
            I don't blame you. It was
            unforgivable.

                         BUD
            I forgive you.

                         FRAN
            You shouldn't.

                         BUD
            You couldn't help yourself. I mean,
            when you're having a drink with one
            man, you can't just suddenly walk
            out on him because you have another
            date with another man. You did the
            only decent thing.

                         FRAN
            Don't be too sure. Just because I
            wear a uniform -- that doesn't make
            me a Girl Scout.

                         BUD
            Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be
            a second administrative assistant
            around here unless he's a pretty
            good judge of character -- and as
            far as I'm concerned, you're tops.
            I mean, decency-wise -- and
            otherwise-wise.
                   (toasting)
            Cheers.

                         FRAN
            Cheers.

They down their drinks. Bud takes the empty cup from her.

                         BUD
            One more?

                         FRAN
                   (indicating elevator)
            I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.

                         BUD
            You're so right.

He reaches into the elevator, takes a cardboard sign off a
hook, hangs it on the elevator door. It reads USE OTHER
ELEVATOR.

                         BUD
            By the power vested in me, I
            herewith declare this elevator out
            of order.
                   (leading her toward
                   the party)
            Shall we join the natives?

                         FRAN
            Why not?
                   (as they pass a
                   kissing couple)
            They seem friendly enough.

                         BUD
            Don't you believe it. Later on
            there will be human sacrifices --
            white collar workers tossed into
            the computing machines, and punched
            full of those little square holes.

                         FRAN
            How many of those drinks did you
            have?

                         BUD
                   (holding up four fingers)
            Three.

                         FRAN
            I thought so.

They have now reached the entrance to the bar, which is
overflowing with thirsty natives.

                         BUD
            You wait here. I think I hear the
            sound of running water.

He leaves her outside the cubicle, and elbows his way
through the crowd toward the booze-filled water cooler. Out
of another cubicle comes Miss Olsen, cup in hand. She too
has had quite a few. Seeing Fran, she walks up to her, with
an acid smile on her face.

                         MISS OLSEN
            Hi. How's the branch manager from
            Kansas City?

                         FRAN
            I beg your pardon?
                         MISS OLSEN
            I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's
            secretary.

                         FRAN
            Yes, I know.

                         MISS OLSEN
            So you don't have to play innocent
            with me. He used to tell his wife
            that I was the branch manager from
            Seattle -- four years ago when we
            were having a little ring-a-ding-
            ding.

                         FRAN
            I don't know what you're talking
            about.

                         MISS OLSEN
            And before me there was Miss Rossi
            in Auditing -- and after me there
            was Miss Koch in Disability -- and
            just before you there was Miss
            What's-Her-Name, on the twenty-
            fifth floor --

                         FRAN
                   (wanting to get away)
            Will you excuse me?

                         MISS OLSEN
                   (holding her by the arm)
            What for? You haven't done
            anything -- it's him -- what a
            salesman -- always the last booth
            in the Chinese restaurant -- and
            the same pitch about divorcing his
            wife -- and in the end you wind up
            with egg foo yong on your face.

Bud comes burrowing out of the crowded cubicle, balancing
the two filled paper cups, spots Fran.

                         BUD
            Miss Kubelik.

Fran turns away from Miss Olsen.

                         FRAN
            Well -- thank you.

                         MISS OLSEN
            Always happy to do something for
            our girls in uniform.

She moves off as Bud joins Fran, who is looking a little pale.

                         BUD
            You all right? What's the matter?

                         FRAN
            Nothing.
                   (takes the drink)
            There are just too many people here.

                         BUD
            Why don't we step into any office?
            There's something I want your
            advice about, anyway.
                   (leads her toward his cubicle)
            I have my own office now, naturally.
            And you may be interested to know
            I'm the second youngest executive
            in the company -- the only one
            younger is a grandson of the
            chairman of the board.

INT. BAXTER'S OFFICE - DAY

Bud ushers Fran in, and is confronted by a strange couple
necking in the corner. He gestures them out, crosses to his
desk.

                         BUD
            Miss Kubelik, I would like your
            honest opinion. I've had this in my
            desk for a week -- cost me fifteen
            dollars -- but I just couldn't get
            up enough nerve to wear it --

From under the desk he has produced a hatbox, and out of the
hatbox a black bowler, which he now puts on his head.

                         BUD
            It's what they call the junior
            executive model. What do you think?

Fran looks at him blankly, absorbed in her own thoughts.

                         BUD
            Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?

                         FRAN
                   (paying attention again)
            No -- I like it.

                         BUD
            Really? You mean you wouldn't be
            ashamed to be seen with somebody in
            a hat like this?

                         FRAN
            Of course not.

                         BUD
            Maybe if I wore it a little more to
            the side --
                   (adjusting hat)
            is that better?

                         FRAN
            Much better.

                         BUD
            Well, as long as you wouldn't be
            ashamed to be seen with me -- how
            about the three of us going out
            this evening -- you and me and the
            bowler -- stroll down Fifth
            Avenue -- sort of break it in --

                         FRAN
            This is a bad day for me.

                         BUD
            I understand. Christmas -- family
            and all that --

                         FRAN
            I'd better get back to my elevator.
            I don't want to be fired.

                         BUD
            Oh, you don't have to worry about
            that. I have quite a bit of
            influence in Personnel. You know Mr.
            Sheldrake?

                         FRAN
                   (guardedly)
            Why?

                         BUD
            He and I are like this.
                   (crosses his fingers)
            Sent me a Christmas card. See?

He has picked up a Christmas card from his desk, shows it to
Fran. It is a photograph of the Sheldrake clan grouped
around an elaborate Christmas tree -- Mr. and Mrs.
Sheldrake, the two boys in military school uniforms, and a
big French poodle. Underneath it says:

                     SEASON'S GREETINGS
                     from the SHELDRAKES
                Emily, Jeff, Tommy, Jeff Jr.,
                         and Figaro.

                         FRAN
                   (studying the card ruefully)
            Makes a cute picture.

                         BUD
            I thought maybe I could put in a
            word for you with Mr. Sheldrake --
            get you a little promotion -- how
            would you like to be an elevator
            starter?

                         FRAN
            I'm afraid there are too many other
            girls around here with seniority
            over me.

                         BUD
            No problem. Why don't we discuss it
            sometime over the holidays -- I
            could call you and pick you up and
            we'll have the big unveiling --
                   (touching the brim of
                   his bowler)
            -- you sure this is the right way
            to wear it?

                         FRAN
            I think so.

                         BUD
            You don't think it's tilted a
            little too much --

Fran takes her compact out of her uniform pocket, opens it,
hands it to Bud.

                         FRAN
            Here.

                         BUD
                   (examining himself in
                   the mirror)
            After all, this is a conservative
            firm -- I don't want people to
            think I'm an entertainer --

His voice trails off. There is something familiar about the
cracked mirror of the compact -- and the fleur-de-lis
pattern on the case confirms his suspicion. Fran notices the
peculiar expression on his face.

                         FRAN
            What is it?

                         BUD
                   (with difficulty)
            The mirror -- it's broken.

                         FRAN
            I know. I like it this way -- makes
            me look the way I feel.

The phone has started to ring. Bud doesn't hear it. He
closes the compact, hands it to Fran.

                         FRAN
            Your phone.

                         BUD
            Oh.
                   (picks up phone from desk)
            Yes?
                   (throws a quick look
                   at Fran)
            Just a minute.
                   (covers mouthpiece;
                   to Fran)
            If you don't mind -- this is sort
            of personal

                         FRAN
            All right. Have a nice Christmas.

She exits, closing the door. Bud takes his hand off the
mouthpiece.

                         BUD
                   (every word hurts)
            Yes, Mr. Sheldrake -- no, I didn't
            forget -- the tree is up and the
            Tom and Jerry mix is in the
            refrigerator -- yes, sir -- same to
            you.

He hangs up, stands there for a moment, the bowler still on
his head, the noise from the party washing over him. He
slowly crosses to the clothes-tree. picks up his coat -- a
new, black chesterfield. With the coat over his arm, he
starts out of the office.

INT. NINETEENTH FLOOR - DAY

The party has picked up tempo. On top of the desks, Sylvia
is doing a mock strip tease -- without taking any clothes
off. There is hollering, drinking and clapping all around her.

Bud moves past the floor show, paying no attention. Kirkeby
spots him, detaches himself from the cheering section around
Sylvia.

                         KIRKEBY
            Where you going, Buddy-boy? The
            party's just starting.
                   (catching up with him)
            Listen, kid -- give me a break,
            will you -- how about tomorrow
            afternoon? I can't take her to that
            drive-in again -- the car doesn't
            even have a heater four o'clock --
            okay?

Bud ignores him, continues walking through the ranks of
empty desks.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CHEAP BAR - COLUMBUS AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - EVENING

It is six o'clock, and the joint is crowded with customers
having one for the road before joining their families for
Christmas Eve. There are men with gaily wrapped packages,
small trussed-up Christmas trees, a plucked turkey in a
plastic bag. Written across the mirror behind the bar, in
glittering white letters, is HAPPY HOLIDAYS. Everybody is in
high spirits, laughing it up and toasting each other.

Everybody except Bud Baxter. He is standing at the bar in
his chesterfield and bowler, slightly isolated, brooding
over an almost empty martini glass. The bartender comes up,
sets down a fresh martini with an olive on a toothpick,
takes his payment from a pile of bills and coins lying in
front of Bud. Bud fishes out the olive, adds it to half a
dozen other impaled olives neatly arranged in fan shape on
the counter. He is obviously trying to complete the circle.

A short, rotund man dressed as Santa Claus hurries in from
the street, and comes up to the bar beside Bud.

                         SANTA CLAUS
                   (to bartender)
            Hey, Charlie -- give me a shot of
            bourbon -- and step on it -- my
            sleigh is double parked.

He laughs uproariously at his own joke, nudges Bud with his
elbow. Bud stares at him coldly, turns back to his martini.
The laughter dies in Santa Claus' throat. He gets his short
of bourbon, moves down the bar to find more convivial company.

Standing near the end of the curved bar is a girl in her
middle twenties wearing a ratty fur coat. Her name is MARGIE
MacDOUGALL, she is drinking a Rum Collins through a straw,
and she too is alone. From a distance, she is studying Bud
with interest. On the bar in front of her is a container of
straws in paper wrappers. She takes one of them out, tears
off the end of the paper, blows through the straw -- sending
the wrapper floating toward Bud. The paper wrapper passes
right in front of Bud's nose. He doesn't notice it.

Margie, undaunted, lets go with another missile.

This time the wrapper lands on the brim of Bud's bowler. No
reaction. Another wrapper comes floating in, hits Bud's
cheek. He never takes his eye off his martini.

Margie leaves her place, and carrying her handbag and her
empty glass, comes up alongside Bud. Without a word, she
reaches up and removes the wrapper from Bud's bowler.

                         MARGIE
            You buy me a drink, I'll buy you
            some music.
                   (sets the glass down)
            Rum Collins.

Not waiting for an answer, she heads for the juke box. Bud
looks after her noncommittally, then turns to the bartender.

                         BUD
            Rum Collins.
                   (indicating martini glass)
            And another one of these little
            mothers.

At the juke box, Margie has dropped a coin in and made her
selection. The music starts -- ADESTE FIDELIS. She rejoins
Bud at the bar just as the bartender is putting down their
drinks in front of them. Bud removes the new olive, adds it
to the pattern on the counter in front of him. They both
drink, staring straight ahead. For quite a while, there is
complete silence between them.

                         MARGIE
                   (out of nowhere)
            You like Castro?
                   (a blank look from Bud)
            I mean -- how do you feel about
            Castro?
                         BUD
            What is Castro?

                         MARGIE
            You know, that big-shot down in
            Cuba with the crazy beard.

                         BUD
            What about him?

                         MARGIE
            Because as far as I'm concerned,
            he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago
            I wrote him a letter -- never even
            answered me.

                         BUD
            That so.

                         MARGIE
            All I wanted him to do was let
            Mickey out for Christmas.

                         BUD
            Who is Mickey?

                         MARGIE
            My husband. He's in Havana -- in
            jail.

                         BUD
            Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?

                         MARGIE
            Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like
            that. He's a jockey. They caught
            him doping a horse.

                         BUD
            Well, you can't win 'em all.

They sit there silently for a moment, contemplating the
injustices of the world.

                         MARGIE
                   (to herself)
            'Twas the night before Christmas
            And all through the house
            Not a creature was stirring --
            Nothing --
            No action --
            Dullsville!
                   (drinks; to Bud)
            You married?

                         BUD
            No.

                         MARGIE
            Family?

                         BUD
            No.

                         MARGIE
            A night like this, it sort of
            spooks you to walk into an empty
            apartment.

                         BUD
            I said I had no family -- I didn't
            say I had an empty apartment.

They both drink.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - EVENING

The living room is dark, except for a shaft of light from
the kitchen, and the glow of the colored bulbs on a small
Christmas tree in front of the phony fireplace.

Hunched up in one corner of the couch is Fran, still in her
coat and gloves, crying softly. Pacing up and down is
Sheldrake. His coat and hat are on a chair, as are several
Christmas packages. On the coffee table are an unopened
bottle of Scotch, a couple of untouched glasses, and a bowl
of melting ice.

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (stops and faces Fran)
            Come on, Fran -- don't be like that.
            You just going to sit there and
            keep bawling?
                   (no answer)
            You won't talk to me, you won't
            tell me what's wrong --
                   (a new approach)
            Look, I know you think I'm stalling
            you. But when you've been married
            to a woman for twelve years, you
            don't just sit down at the breakfast
            table and say "Pass the sugar --
            and I want a divorce." It's not
            that easy.
                   (he resumes pacing;
                   Fran continues crying)
            Anyway, this is the wrong time. The
            kids are home from school -- my in-
            laws are visiting for the
            holidays -- I can't bring it up now.
                   (stops in front of her)
            This isn't like you, Fran -- you
            were always such a good sport --
            such fun to be with --

                         FRAN
                   (through tears)
            Yeah -- that's me. The Happy
            Idiot -- a million laughs.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Well, that's more like it. At least
            you're speaking to me.

                         FRAN
            Funny thing happened to me at the
            office party today -- I ran into
            your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You
            know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed
            so much I like to died.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Is that what's been bothering
            you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient
            history.

                         FRAN
            I was never very good at history.
            Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen,
            and then there was Miss Rossi --
            no, she came before -- it was Miss
            Koch who came after Miss Olsen --

                         SHELDRAKE
            Now, Fran --

                         FRAN
            And just think -- right now there's
            some lucky girl in the building
            who's going to come after me --

                         SHELDRAKE
            Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that.
            But just ask yourself -- why does a
            man run around with a lot of girls?
            Because he's unhappy at home --
            because he's lonely, that's why --
            all that was before you, Fran --
            I've stopped running.

Fran has taken a handkerchief out of her bag and is dabbing
her eyes.

                         FRAN
            How could I be so stupid? You'd
            think I would have learned by
            now -- when you're in love with a
            married man, you shouldn't wear
            mascara.

                         SHELDRAKE
            It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's
            not fight.

                         FRAN
            Merry Christmas.

She hands him a flat, wrapped package.

                         SHELDRAKE
            What is it?

He strips away the wrapping to reveal a long-playing record.
The cover reads: RICKSHAW BOY - Jimmy Lee Kiang with
Orchestra.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Oh. Our friend from the Chinese
            restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better
            keep it here.

                         FRAN
            Yeah, we better.

                         SHELDRAKE
            I have a present for you. I didn't
            quite know what to get you --
            anyway it's a little awkward for
            me, shopping --
                   (he has taken out a
                   money clip, detaches
                   a bill)
            -- so here's a hundred dollars --
            go out and buy yourself something.

He holds the money out, but she doesn't move. Sheldrake
slips the bill into her open bag.

                         SHELDRAKE
            They have some nice alligator bags
            at Bergdorf's --

Fran gets up slowly and starts peeling off her gloves.
Sheldrake looks at her, then glances nervously at his wrist
watch.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Fran, it's a quarter to seven --
            and I mustn't miss the train -- if
            we hadn't wasted all that time -- I
            have to get home and trim the
            tree --

Fran has started to remove her coat.

                         FRAN
            Okay.
                   (shrugs the coat back on)
            I just thought as long as it was
            paid for --

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (an angry step toward her)
            Don't ever talk like that, Fran!
            Don't make yourself out to be cheap.

                         FRAN
            A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call
            that cheap. And you must be paying
            somebody something for the use of
            the apartment --

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (grabbing her arms)
            Stop that, Fran.

                         FRAN
                   (quietly)
            You'll miss your train, Jeff.

Sheldrake hurriedly puts on his hat and coat, gathers up his
packages.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Coming?

                         FRAN
            You run along -- I want to fix my
            face.

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (heading for the door)
            Don't forget to kill the lights.
            See you Monday.

                         FRAN
            Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and
            Monday again -- and Thursday
            again --

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (that stops him in
                   the half-open door)
            It won't always be like this.
                   (coming back)
            I love you, Fran.

Holding the packages to one side, he tries to kiss her on
the mouth.

                         FRAN
                   (turning her head)
            Careful -- lipstick.

He kisses her on the cheek, hurries out of the apartment,
closing the door. Fran stands there for a while, blinking
back tears, then takes the long-playing record out of its
envelope, crosses to the phonograph. She puts the record on,
starts the machine -- the music is JEALOUS LOVER. As it
plays, Fran wanders aimlessly around the darkened room, her
body wracked by sobs. Finally she regains control of herself,
and picking up her handbag, starts through the bedroom
toward the bathroom.

In the bathroom, Fran switches on the light, puts her bag on
the sink, turns on the faucet. Scooping up some water, she
washes the smeared mascara away, then turns the faucet off,
picks up a towel As she is drying her face, she notices in
the pull-away shaving mirror the magnified reflection of a
vial of pills on the medicine shelf. Fran reaches out for
the vial, turns it slowly around in her hand. The label
reads: SECONAL - ONE AT BEDTIME AS NEEDED FOR SLEEP.

Fran studies the label for a second, then returns the vial
to the shelf. She opens her handbag, takes out a lipstick.
As she does so, she sees the hundred dollar bill Sheldrake
left in the bag. Her eyes wander back to the vial on the
medicine shelf. Then very deliberately she picks up Bud's
mouthwash glass, removes the two toothbrushes from it, turns
on the faucet, starts filling the glass with water.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:
INT. CHEAP BAR - COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT

The joint is deserted now except for the Santa Claus, who is
leaning against the bar, quite loaded, and Bud and Margie
MacDougall, who are dancing to a slow blues coming from the
juke box. Bud is still in his overcoat and bowler, and
Margie is wearing her fur coat. The bartender is sweeping up
the place.

                         BARTENDER
                   (to Santa Claus)
            Drink up, Pop. It's closing time.

                         SANTA CLAUS
            But it's early, Charlie.

                         BARTENDER
            Don't you know what night this is?

                         SANTA CLAUS
            I know, Charlie. I know. I work for
            the outfit.

He polishes off his drink, walks out unsteadily. The
bartender approaches the dancers.

                         BARTENDER
            Hey, knock it off, will you? Go home.

Bud and Margie ignore him, continue dancing -- or rather
swaying limply cheek-to-cheek. The bartender crosses to the
juke box, pulls the plug out. The music stops, but not Bud
and Margie -- they continue dancing.

                         BARTENDER
            O-U-T -- out!

He goes to the front of the bar, starts to extinguish the
lights. Margie picks up her handbag from the bar, and Bud
downs the remains of his drink.

                         MARGIE
            Where do we go -- my place or yours?

                         BUD
                   (peering at his watch)
            Might as well go to mine --
            everybody else does.

He leads her through the dark bar toward the entrance. The
bartender holds the door open for them as they go out.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT

Bud and Margie come walking down the street. As they reach
the house, Bud starts up the steps, but Margie continues
along the sidewalk.

                         MARGIE
            Poor Mickey -- when I think of him
            all by himself in that jail in
            Havana --
                   (opening her handbag)
            -- want to see his picture?

                         BUD
                   (from steps)
            Not particularly.

Margie, realizing her mistake, hurries back to join him.

                         MARGIE
            He's so cute -- five-foot-two --
            ninety-nine pounds...like a little
            chihuahua.

They pass through the front door into the vestibule.

INT. STAIRCASE - BROWNSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT

Bud and Margie are mounting the stairs toward the apartment.

                         MARGIE
            Can I ask you a personal question?

                         BUD
            No.

                         MARGIE
            You got a girl-friend?

                         BUD
            She may be a girl -- but she's no
            friend of mine.

                         MARGIE
            Still stuck on her, huh.

                         BUD
            Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't
            know me very well.

                         MARGIE
            I don't know you at all.
                         BUD
            Permit me -- C.C. Baxter -- junior
            executive, Arthur Murray graduate,
            lover.

                         MARGIE
            I'm Mrs. MacDougall -- Margie to you.

Bud has taken the key out of his pocket, opened the door to
his apartment.

                         BUD
            This way, Mrs. MacDougall.

He ushers her in.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

It is exactly the way we left it. There is no sign of Fran,
except for the gloves she dropped on the coffee table
earlier. Bud switches on the light, shuts the door.

                         MARGIE
                   (looking around)
            Say, this is Snugsville.

                         BUD
                   (helping her out of
                   her coat)
            Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only
            fair to warn you that you are now
            alone with a notorious sexpot.

                         MARGIE
                   (a gleam)
            No kidding.

                         BUD
            Ask anybody around here. As a
            matter of fact, when it's time for
            me to go -- and I may go just like
            that --
                   (snaps his fingers)
            -- I have promised my body to the
            Columbia Medical Center.

                         MARGIE
                   (shuddering deliciously)
            Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps
            just to think about it.

                         BUD
            Well, they haven't got me yet, baby.
            Dig up some ice from the kitchen
            and let's not waste any time --
            preliminary-wise.

                         MARGIE
            I'm with you, lover.

She takes the bowl of melted ice Bud has handed her,
disappears into the kitchen. As Bud starts to remove his
coat, he becomes aware of a scratching noise from the
phonograph. He crosses to it, sees that the needle is stuck
in the last groove of a long-playing record.

Bud lifts the record off, examines it curiously, then puts
it aside and substitutes the cha cha record. As the music
starts, he dances over to the coat-rack beside the door,
hangs up his chesterfield and bowler. He turns back into the
room, still dancing, suddenly spots Fran's gloves on the
coffee table. He picks up the gloves, looks around for some
convenient place to get rid of them. Moving over to the
bedroom door, he opens it, tosses the gloves toward the bed
inside. He shuts the door, starts to turn away, freezes in a
delayed reaction to something he saw inside. He quickly
opens the door again, looks.

Sprawled across the bed, on top of the bedspread, is Fran.
The light from the bathroom falls across her. She is fully
dressed, still in her coat, and apparently asleep.

Bud steps into the bedroom, closing the door behind him,
walks over to Fran.

                         BUD
            All right, Miss Kubelik -- get up.
            It's past checking-out time, and
            the hotel management would
            appreciate it if you would get the
            hell out of here.
                   (Fran doesn't stir)
            Look, Miss Kubelik, I used to like
            you -- I used to like you a lot --
            but it's all over between us -- so
            beat it -- O-U-T -- out!
                   (no reaction; he puts
                   a hand on her
                   shoulder, shakes her)
            Come on -- wake up!

She doesn't respond. But something falls out of her hand,
rolls across the bed. Bud picks it up, looks at it -- it is
his sleeping-pill vial, now uncapped and empty.
                         BUD
                   (a hoarse whisper)
            Oh, my God.

For a second he is paralyzed. Then he drops the vial, grabs
Fran, lifts her into a sitting position on the bed, shakes
her violently.

                         BUD
            Miss Kubelik! Miss Kubelik!

Fran's head droops to one side, like a rag doll's. Bud lets
go of her, rushes out.

In the living room, the phonograph is still cha cha-ing away.
Bud dashes to the phone, picks it up. Then it occurs to him
that he doesn't know whom to call and he hangs up. Out of
the kitchen comes Margie, with a bowlful of ice cubes.

                         MARGIE
            I broke a nail trying to get the
            ice-tray out. You ought to buy
            yourself a new refrigerator.

Bud, not listening, runs past her to the hall door and out.

                         MARGIE
                   (calling after him)
            I didn't mean right now.

INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

Bud arrives at the door of the Dreyfuss apartment, starts
ringing the doorbell and pounding with his fist.

                         BUD
            Dr. Dreyfuss! Hey, Doc!

The door opens, and Dr. Dreyfuss stands there sleepily,
pulling on his beaten bathrobe.

                         BUD
                   (words tumbling over
                   each other)
            There's a girl in my place -- she
            took some sleeping pills -- you
            better come quick -- I can't wake
            her up.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Let me get my bag.

He disappears from the doorway.

                         BUD
            Hurry up, Doc.

Bud turns and runs back into his apartment.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

Margie has settled herself comfortably on the couch, and is
fixing the drinks. The cha cha music is still going. Bud
comes flying in, heads for the bedroom.

                         MARGIE
            Hey -- over here, lover.

Bud stops in his tracks, suddenly aware of her.

                         MARGIE
            What's all this running around?
            You're going to wear yourself out.

Bud strides over to her purposefully, yanks her up to her
feet.

                         MARGIE
            Not so rough, honey.

                         BUD
                   (taking the glass out
                   of her hand)
            Good night.

                         MARGIE
            Good night?

                         BUD
                   (thrusting the fur
                   coat at her)
            The party's over.

                         MARGIE
            What's the matter? Did I do
            something wrong?

                         BUD
                   (easing her toward door)
            It's an emergency -- see you some
            other time.

Dr. Dreyfuss comes hurrying in, carrying his medical bag. He
stops, bewildered by the sound of music and the sight of a
wide-awake girl in the apartment.

                         BUD
            Not this one --
                   (pointing to the bedroom)
            -- in there, Doc.

Dr. Dreyfuss proceeds into the bedroom.

                         MARGIE
            Say, what's going on here, anyway?

                         BUD
            Nothing.
                   (propelling her
                   toward the door)
            Just clear out, will you?

                         MARGIE
                   (pointing back)
            My shoes.

Bud reaches under the coffee table, where she left her
shoes, retrieves them.

                         MARGIE
                   (bitterly)
            Some lover you are. Some sexpot!

Bud shoves the shoes at her, takes a bill out of his wallet,
hands it to her.

                         BUD
            Here -- find yourself a phone booth
            and call your husband in Havana.

                         MARGIE
            You bet I will. And when I tell him
            how you treated me, he'll push your
            face in.
                   (he shoves her
                   through the open door)
            You fink!

Bud slams the door shut, starts toward the bedroom. Halfway
there, he becomes aware that the cha cha record is still on.
He detours to the phonograph, switches it off, continues
into the bedroom.

In the bedroom, the overhead light is on, and Dr. Dreyfuss
is working on the unconscious Fran. He has removed her coat,
and is shining a flashlight into her eyes, examining her
pupils. Bud approaches the bed worriedly.

                         BUD
            She going to be all right, Doc?

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            How many pills were in that bottle?

                         BUD
            It was half-full -- about a dozen
            or so. You going to have to take
            her to the hospital?

Dr. Dreyfuss ignores him. Out of his medical bag, he takes a
stomach tube with a rubber funnel at the end. Then he starts
to lift Fran off the bed.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Help me, will you?

Between them, they get Fran into an upright position.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Into the bathroom.

They half-carry, half-drag Fran's limp form toward the
bathroom.

                         BUD
            What are you going to do, Doc?

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Get that stuff out of her stomach --
            if it isn't too late. You better
            put some coffee on -- and pray.

Bud starts away as Dr. Dreyfuss takes Fran into the bathroom.

Bud loses no time getting into the kitchen. He fills an
aluminum kettle with water, strikes a match, lights the gas
burner, puts the kettle on. Then he takes a jar of instant
coffee and a chipped coffee mug out of the cupboard, shakes
an excessive portion of coffee into the mug, sticks a spoon
in it. He watches the kettle for a moment, mops his brow
with a handkerchief, then starts back toward the bedroom.

Bud crosses the bedroom to the half-open door of the
bathroom, looks in anxiously. From inside come the sounds of
a coughing spasm and running water. Bud turns away, undoes
his tie and collar, paces the bedroom floor. Something on
the night table attracts his attention -- resting against
the base of the lamp is a sealed envelope. Bud picks it
up -- on it, in Fran's handwriting, is one word, JEFF. He
turns the letter over in his hand, trying to decide what to
do with it.

Dr. Dreyfuss emerges from the bathroom, carrying a pale,
still unconscious Fran. Bud quickly conceals the suicide
note behind his back.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Bring my bag.

He lugs Fran into the living room. Bud stashes the letter in
his back pocket, picks up the medical bag, follows them.

In the living room, Dr. Dreyfuss lowers Fran into a chair.
Her chin falls to her chest. Dreyfuss takes the bag from
Bud, fishes out a hypodermic syringe, draws 2 c.c.'s from a
bottle of picrotoxin.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Roll up her right sleeve.

Bud does so. Dr. Dreyfuss hands the hypodermic to Bud,
searches for a spot for the injection.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Nice veins.

He swabs the spot with alcohol, takes the hypodermic back
from Bud.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Want to tell me what happened?

                         BUD
            I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't
            here -- you see -- we had some
            words earlier -- nothing serious,
            really -- what you might call a
            lovers' quarrel --

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (making off-scene injection)
            So you went right out and picked
            yourself up another dame.

                         BUD
            Something like that.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            You know, Baxter, you're a real
            cutie-pie -- yes, you are.

Bud just stands there, taking it. Fran stirs slightly, and
from her parched lips comes a low moan. Dr. Dreyfuss grabs
her by the hair, lifts her head up.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            If you'd come home half an hour
            later, you would have had quite a
            Christmas present.

With his free hand, Dr. Dreyfuss slaps Fran viciously across
the face. Bud winces. Dreyfuss, still holding Fran by the
hair, takes a box of ammonia ampules out of his bag. He
crushes one of the ampules in his hand, passes it under her
nose. Fran tries to turn her head away. Dreyfuss slaps her
again, hard, crushes another ampule, repeats the process.

Bud is watching tensely. From the kitchen comes the whistle
of the boiling kettle, but Bud pays no attention.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Get the coffee.

Bud hurries into the kitchen. He turns off the gas, pours
the boiling water into the mug with the instant coffee,
stirs it. From off, come the sounds of more slapping and
some moaning. Bud carries the coffee out.

In the living room, Dr. Dreyfuss is working another ammonia
ampule under Fran's nose. Her eyes start fluttering. Dreyfuss
takes the coffee mug from Bud, forces it between Fran's
lips, pours coffee into her mouth. Fran resists
instinctively, half the coffee dribbling over her chin and
dress, but Dr. Dreyfuss keeps at it.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Let's get some air in here. Open
            the windows.

Bud complies promptly -- pulls up the shades, opens the
windows wide.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (putting the empty
                   mug down)
            What's her name?

                         BUD
            Miss Kubelik -- Fran.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (to Fran, slowly)
            Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here
            because you took too many sleeping
            pills. Do you understand what I'm
            saying?
                   (Fran mutters something)
            Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss -- I'm here
            to help you. You took all those
            sleeping pills -- remember?

                         FRAN
                   (mumbling groggily)
            Sleeping pills.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.

                         FRAN
            Doctor.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Dr. Dreyfuss.

                         FRAN
            Dreyfuss.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (to Bud)
            Get more coffee.

Bud picks up the mug, leaves.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (to Fran)
            Tell me again -- what's my name?

                         FRAN
            Dr. Dreyfuss.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            And what happened to you?

                         FRAN
            I took sleeping pills.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Do you know where you are, Fran?

                         FRAN
                   (looking around blankly)
            No.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Yes, you do. Now concentrate.

                         FRAN
            I don't know.

Bud is coming back with the coffee.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (pointing to Bud)
            Do you know who this is?
                   (Fran tries to focus)
            Look at him.

                         FRAN
            Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.

                         BUD
            Hello, Miss Kubelik.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (to Bud)
            Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!

                         BUD
                   (to Dr. Dreyfuss, discreetly)
            Well -- we work in the same
            building -- and we try to keep it
            quiet --

                         FRAN
                   (to Bud, puzzled)
            What are you doing here?

Bud throws Dr. Dreyfuss a look, as if to say that Fran's
mind still wasn't functioning properly.

                         BUD
                   (to Fran)
            Don't you remember? We were at the
            office party together --

                         FRAN
            Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss
            Olsen --

                         BUD
            That's right.
                   (to Dr. Dreyfuss;
                   improvising rapidly)
            I told you we had a fight -- that's
            what it was about -- Miss Olsen --
            you know that other girl you saw --

                         FRAN
                   (still trying to
                   figure out Bud's presence)
            I don't understand --

                         BUD
            It's not important, Fran -- the
            main thing is that I got here in
            time -- and you're going to be all
            right --
                   (to Dr. Dreyfuss)
            -- isn't she, Doc?

                         FRAN
                   (closing her eyes)
            I'm so tired --
                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Here -- drink this.

He forces her to swallow some coffee.

                         FRAN
                   (pushing the mug away)
            Please -- just let me sleep.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            You can't sleep.
                   (shaking her)
            Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.
                   (to Bud)
            Let's get her walking. We've got to
            keep her awake for the next couple
            of hours.

They lift her from the chair, and each draping one of her
arms over his shoulder, they start to walk her up and down
the room.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (urging Fran on)
            Now walk, Fran. One, two, three,
            four -- one, two, three, four --
            that's the idea -- left, right,
            left, right -- now we turn -- one,
            two, three, four --

At first, Fran's feet just drag along the floor between them.
But gradually, as Dr. Dreyfuss' voice continues droning
hypnotically, she falls into the rhythm of it, repeating the
words after him and putting her weight on her feet.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Left, right, left, right -- walk,
            walk, walk -- one, two, three,
            four -- turn -- left, right, left,
            right -- now you got it --

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. THE APARTMENT - DAWN

Through the bedroom window comes the first faint light of
dawn. Fran has been put to bed by an exhausted Dr. Dreyfuss.
She is in her slip, and Dreyfuss is just drawing the blanket
over her. Her eyes are closed, and she is moaning fitfully.
Watching from the doorway is Bud, in shirtsleeves now, weary
and disheveled.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            She'll sleep on and off for the
            next twenty-four hours. Of course,
            she'll have a dandy hangover when
            she wakes up --

                         BUD
            Just as long as she's okay.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (massaging his calves)
            These cases are harder on the
            doctor than on the patient. I ought
            to charge you by the mile.

They have now moved out into the living room, where the
overhead light and the Christmas tree bulbs are still on.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Any of that coffee left?

                         BUD
            Sure.

He goes into the kitchen. Dr. Dreyfuss takes a small notebook
with a fountain pen clipped to it out of his bag, sinks down
on the couch.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            How do you spell her last name?

                         BUD
                   (from kitchen)
            Kubelik -- with two k's.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            What's her address?
                   (no answer from Bud)
            Where does she live?

Bud appears from the kitchen, stirring the coffee powder in
a cup of hot water.

                         BUD
                   (apprehensive)
            Why do you want to know, Doc? You
            don't have to report this, do you?

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            It's regulations.

                         BUD
                   (setting the coffee down)
            She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was
            an accident -- she had a little too
            much to drink and -- she didn't
            know what she was doing -- there
            was no suicide note or anything --
            believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking
            about myself --

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (sipping the hot coffee)
            Aren't you?

                         BUD
            It's just that she's got a family --
            and there's the people in the
            office -- look, Doc, can't you
            forget you're a doctor -- let's
            just say you're here as a neighbor --

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (a long look at Bud)
            Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't
            prove it wasn't an accident.
                   (closes notebook)
            But as your neighbor, I'd like to
            kick your keester clear around the
            block.
                   (indicating coffee)
            Mind if I cool this off?

He uncaps the bottle of Scotch, pours a large slug into his
coffee.

                         BUD
            Help yourself.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (taking a big gulp of
                   the spiked coffee)
            I don't know what you did to that
            girl in there -- and don't tell
            me -- but it was bound to happen,
            the way you carry on. Live now, pay
            later. Diner's Club!
                   (another swig)
            Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a
            mensch! You know what that means?

                         BUD
            I'm not sure.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            A mansch -- a human being! So you
            got off easy this time -- so you
            were lucky --

                         BUD
            Yeah, wasn't I?

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (finishing coffee)
            But you're not out of the woods
            yet, Baxter -- because most of them
            try it again!
                   (picks up bag, starts
                   toward door)
            You know where I am if you need me.

He walks out, closing the door after him. Bud dejectedly
turns off the overhead light, kicks out the plug of the
Christmas tree lights, trudges into the bedroom.

Fran is fast asleep. Bud picks up her dress, gets a hanger,
drapes the dress over it, hangs it from the door. An early
morning chill has invaded the room, and Bud switches an the
electric blanket to keep Fran warm. Then he slumps into a
chair beside the bed, looks at Fran compassionately. The
light on the dial of the electric blanket glows in the
grayish room. Bud just sits there, watching Fran.

                                            FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

INT. STAIRCASE - BROWNSTONE HOUSE - DAY

Mrs. Lieberman, followed by her dog, is climbing the stairs
to Bud's apartment, puffing asthmatically. She seems quite
angry as she arrives at the door and rings the bell. There
is no answer. She starts knocking impatiently.

                         MRS. LIEBERMAN
            Mr. Baxter. Open up already!

Finally the door opens a crack, and Bud peers out. He looks
like a man who has slept in his clothes -- rumpled, bleary-
eyed, unshaven.

                         BUD
            Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.

                         MRS. LIEBERMAN
            So who did you think it was -- Kris
            Kringle? What was going on here
            last night?

                         BUD
            Last night?

                         MRS. LIEBERMAN
            All that marching -- tramp, tramp,
            tramp -- you were having army
            maneuvers maybe?

                         BUD
            I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and
            I'll never invite those people again.

                         MRS. LIEBERMAN
            What you get from renting to
            bachelors. All night I didn't sleep
            ten minutes -- and I'm sure you
            woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.

                         BUD
            Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I
            happen to know he was out on a case.

                         MRS. LIEBERMAN
            I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this
            is a respectable house, not a
            honky-tonky.
                   (to the dog)
            Come on, Oscar.

Bud watches her start down the stairs with the dog, withdraws
into the apartment.

INT. THE APARTMENT - DAY

Bud closes the door, crosses toward the bedroom, looks
inside. Fran is asleep under the electric blanket, breathing
evenly. He tries to shut the bedroom door, but it won't
close completely because Fran's dress, on a hanger. is
hooked over the top. He goes to the phone, picks it up,
dials the operator.

                         BUD
                   (his voice low)
            Operator, I want White Plains, New
            York -- Mr. J. D. Sheldrake --
                   (an added thought)
            -- make it person to person.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SHELDRAKE HOUSE - DAY

The decor is split-level Early American. There is a huge
Christmas tree and a jumble of presents, open gift boxes,
and discarded wrappings.

Sheldrake and his two sons, TOMMY and JEFF JR., are squatting
on the floor, testing a Cape Canaveral set the kids got for
Christmas. Sheldrake is in a brand new dressing gown, with a
manufacturer's tag still dangling from it, and the boys are
in pajamas and astronaut's helmets. As for the Cape Canaveral
set, it is a miniature layout of block-houses, launching
pads, and assorted space-missiles. Tommy has his finger on
the button controlling one of the rockets.

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (counting down)
            7-6-5-4-3-2-1 -- let her rip!

Tommy presses the button, and a spring sends the rocket
toward the ceiling. Just then, the phone in the entrance
hall starts ringing.

                         JEFF JR.
            I'll get it.

He hurries to the phone.

                         TOMMY
            Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly
            in the nose cone and see if we can
            bring it back alive?

                         SHELDRAKE
            It's a thought.

                         TOMMY
            Maybe we should send up two flies --
            and see if they'll propagate in
            orbit.

                         SHELDRAKE
            See if they'll what?

                         TOMMY
            Propagate -- you know, multiply --
            baby flies?

                         SHELDRAKE
            Oh -- oh!

                         JEFF JR.
                   (coming back from the phone)
            It's for you, Dad. A Mr. Baxter.

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (getting up)
            Baxter?

                         JEFF JR.
            Person to person.

Sheldrake heads quickly for the phone.

                         TOMMY
                   (to Jeff Jr.)
            Come on -- help me round up some
            flies.

In the entrance hall, Sheldrake picks up the phone, turns
his back toward the living room, speaks in a low voice.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Hello? -- yes -- what's on your
            mind, Baxter?

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            I hate to disturb you, but something
            came up -- it's rather important --
            and I think it would be a good idea
            if you could see me -- at the
            apartment -- as soon as possible.

SHELDRAKE - ON PHONE

                         SHELDRAKE
            You're not making sense, Baxter.
            What's this all about?

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            I didn't want to tell you over the
            phone but that certain party -- you
            know who I mean -- I found her here
            last night -- she had taken an
            overdose of sleeping pills.

SHELDRAKE - ON PHONE

                         SHELDRAKE
            What?

From the stairway beyond him comes:

                         MRS. SHELDRAKE'S VOICE
            What is it, Jeff? Who's on the phone?

Sheldrake turns from the phone. Halfway down the stairs is
Mrs. Sheldrake, in a quilted house-robe.

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (a nice recovery)
            One of our employees had an
            accident -- I don't know why they
            bother me with these things on
            Christmas Day.
                   (into phone)
            Yes, Baxter -- just how serious is
            it?

Out of the corner of his eye, he watches Mrs. Sheldrake come
down the stairs, pass behind him on the way to the living
room.

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            Well, it was touch and go there for
            a while -- but she's sleeping it
            off now.

He glances through the half-open door toward the sleeping
Fran.

                         BUD
            I thought maybe you'd like to be
            here when she wakes up.

SHELDRAKE - ON PHONE

                         SHELDRAKE
            That's impossible.
                   (an apprehensive look
                   toward the living room)
            You'll have to handle this situation
            yourself -- as a matter of fact,
            I'm counting on you --

INT. THE APARTMENT - DAY

                         BUD
                   (into phone)
            Yes, sir -- I understand.
                   (taking Fran's letter
                   out of his pocket)
            She left a note -- you want me to
            open it and read it to you?
                   (a beat)
            Well, it was just a suggestion --
            no, you don't have to worry about
            that, Mr. Sheldrake -- I kept your
            name out of it so there'll be no
            trouble, police-wise or newspaper-
            wise --

As Bud continues talking on the phone, Fran, in the bedroom,
opens her eyes, looks around vaguely, trying to figure out
where she is. She sits up in bed, winces, holds her head in
her hands -- she has a fierce hangover.

                         BUD
                   (into phone)
            -- you see, the doctor, he's a
            friend of mine -- we were very
            lucky in that respect -- actually,
            he thinks she's my girl -- no, he
            just jumped to the conclusion --
            around here, I'm known as quite a
            ladies' man --

In the bedroom Fran, becoming aware of Bud's voice, crawls
out of bed and holding on to the furniture, moves unsteadily
toward the living room door.

                         BUD
                   (into phone)
            -- of course, we're not out of the
            woods yet -- sometimes they try it
            again -- yes sir, I'll do my
            best -- it looks like it'll be a
            couple of days before she's fully
            recovered, and I may have a little
            problem with the landlady --

Behind him, Fran appears in the bedroom doorway, barefooted
and in her slip. She leans groggily against the door post,
trying to focus on Bud and to concentrate on what he's saying.

                         BUD
                   (into phone)
            -- all right, Mr. Sheldrake, I'll
            keep her in my apartment as long as
            I can -- any sort of message you
            want me to give her? -- well, I'll
            think of something -- goodbye, Mr.
            Sheldrake.

He hangs up the phone slowly.

                         FRAN
                   (weakly)
            I'm sorry.

Bud turns around, sees her standing there on rubbery legs.

                         FRAN
            I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.

                         BUD
            Miss Kubelik --
                   (hurries toward her)
            -- you shouldn't be out of bed.

                         FRAN
            I didn't know -- I had no idea this
            was your apartment --

                         BUD
                   (putting his arm
                   around her)
            Let me help you.

He leads her back into the bedroom.

                         FRAN
            I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just
            let me die?

                         BUD
            What kind of talk is that?
                   (he lowers her onto
                   the bed)
            So you got a little over-
            emotional -- but you're fine now.

                         FRAN
                   (a groan)
            My head -- it feels like a big wad
            of chewing gum. What time is it?

                         BUD
            Two o'clock.

                         FRAN
                   (struggling to her feet)
            Where's my dress? I have to go home.

Her knees buckle. Bud catches her.

                         BUD
            You're in no condition to go
            anywhere -- except back to bed.

                         FRAN
            You don't want me here --

                         BUD
            Sure I do. It's always nice to have
            company for Christmas.

He tries to put her back to bed. Fran resists.

                         BUD
            Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you
            are --

                         FRAN
            I just want to go brush my teeth --

                         BUD
            Oh -- of course. I think there's a
            new toothbrush somewhere.

He crosses to the bathroom, takes a plaid robe off the hook
on the back of the door, hands it to Fran.

                         BUD
            Here -- put this on.

In the bathroom, he finds an unused toothbrush in a plastic
container. His eyes fall on his safety razor. With a glance
toward the bedroom, he unscrews the razor, removes the
blade, drops it in his shirt pocket. Then he empties the
blades from the dispenser, puts those in his pocket. Now he
notices a bottle of iodine on the medicine shelf, stashes
that in another pocket, just as Fran appears in the doorway
wearing the robe.

                         BUD
                   (handing her the toothbrush)
            Here. How about some breakfast?

                         FRAN
            No -- I don't want anything.

                         BUD
            I'll fix you some coffee.

He crosses the bedroom, heading for the kitchen, stops.

                         BUD
            Oh -- we're all out of coffee --
            you had quite a lot of it last
            night --

He thinks for a moment, hurries toward the hall door.

INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - DAY

Bud comes out of his apartment, leaving the door half open,
heads for the Dreyfuss apartment. He rings the bell, peers
down over the banister to make sure Mrs. Lieberman isn't
snooping around. Mrs. Dreyfuss opens the door.

                         BUD
            Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some
            coffee -- and maybe an orange and a
            couple of eggs?

                         MRS. DREYFUSS
                   (contemptuously)
            Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What
            you need is a good horse-whipping.

                         BUD
            Ma'am?

                         MRS. DREYFUSS
            From me the doctor has no secrets.
            Poor girl -- how could you do a
            thing like that?

                         BUD
            I didn't really do anything --
            honest -- I mean, you take a girl
            out a couple of times a week --
            just for laughs -- and right away
            she thinks you're serious --
            marriage-wise.

                         MRS. DREYFUSS
            Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift
            a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a
            little something to eat.

She slams the door in his face, Bud starts back to his
apartment.

INT. THE APARTMENT - DAY

Fran enters shakily from the bedroom, looks around for the
phone, locates it, picks it up. As she starts dialing, Bud
comes in from the hall.

                         BUD
            Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?

                         FRAN
            My sister -- she'll want to know
            what happened to me.

                         BUD
                   (alarmed)
            Wait a minute -- let's talk this
            over first.
                   (hurries up to her,
                   takes the receiver away)
            Just what are you going to tell her?

                         FRAN
            Well, I haven't figured it out,
            exactly.

                         BUD
            You better figure it out -- exactly.
            Suppose she asks you why you didn't
            come home last night?

                         FRAN
            I'll tell her I spent the night
            with a friend.

                         BUD
            Who?

                         FRAN
            Someone from the office.

                         BUD
            And where are you now?

                         FRAN
            In his apartment.

                         BUD
            His apartment?

                         FRAN
            I mean -- her apartment.

                         BUD
            What's your friend's name?

                         FRAN
            Baxter.

                         BUD
            What's her first name?

                         FRAN
            Miss.
                   (she is impressed
                   with her own cleverness)


                         BUD
            When are you coming home?

                         FRAN
            As soon as I can walk.

                         BUD
            Something wrong with your legs?

                         FRAN
            No -- it's my stomach.

                         BUD
            Your stomach?

                         FRAN
            They had to pump it out.

                         BUD
                   (hanging up the phone)
            Miss Kubelik, I don't think you
            ought to call anybody -- not till
            that chewing gum is out of your
            head.
                   (leads her into bedroom)


                         FRAN
            But they'll be worried about me --
            my brother-in-law may be calling
            the police --

                         BUD
            That's why we have to be careful --
            we don't want to involve anybody --
            after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a
            married man --

                         FRAN
            Thanks for reminding me.

She pulls away from him, starts to get into bed.

                         BUD
                   (contritely)
            I didn't mean it that way -- I was
            just talking to him on the phone --
            he's very concerned about you.

                         FRAN
            He doesn't give a damn about me.

                         BUD
            Oh, you're wrong. He told me --

                         FRAN
            He's a liar. But that's not the
            worst part of it -- the worst part
            is -- I still love him.

The doorbell rings.

                         BUD
            Must be Mrs. Dreyfuss --
                   (starts into living room)
            -- remember the doctor -- from last
            night -- that's his wife.

He opens the hall door. Mrs. Dreyfuss brushes past him with
a tray full of food.

                         MRS. DREYFUSS
            So where is the victim?
                   (Bud indicates the bedroom)
            Max the Knife!

She sweeps into the bedroom, Bud tagging along.

                         MRS. DREYFUSS
                   (to Fran)
            Nu, little lady, how are we feeling
            today?

                         FRAN
            I don't know -- kind of dizzy.

                         MRS. DREYFUSS
            Here. The best thing for dizzy is a
            little noodle soup with chicken --
            white meat -- and a glass tea.

She sets the tray down on Fran's lap.

                         FRAN
            Thank you. I'm really not hungry.

                         MRS. DREYFUSS
            Go ahead! Eat! Enjoy!

She hands her the soup spoon, turns to Bud.

                         MRS. DREYFUSS
            You wouldn't have such a thing as a
            napkin, would you?

                         BUD
            Well, I have some paper towels --

                         MRS. DREYFUSS
            Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third
            drawer, under the good silver,
            there is napkins.

                         BUD
            Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two.
Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not
touching the soup.

                         MRS. DREYFUSS
            So what are you waiting for -- a
            singing commercial?

                         FRAN
            I can't eat.

Mrs. Dreyfuss takes the spoon from her, starts to feed her.

                         MRS. DREYFUSS
            You must eat -- and you must get
            healthy -- and you must forget him.
            Such a fine boy he seemed when he
            first moved in here -- clean and
            cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns
            out he is King Farouk. Mit the
            drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit
            the no napkins. A girl like you,
            for the rest of your life you want
            to cry in your noodle soup? Who
            needs it! You listen to me, you
            find yourself a nice, substantial
            man -- a widower maybe -- and
            settle down -- instead of nashing
            all those sleeping pills -- for
            what, for whom? -- for some Good
            Time Charlie?
                   (sees Bud approaching
                   with napkin)
            Sssh!

                         BUD
                   (gaily)
            One napkin, coming up.
                   (hands it to Fran)
            I wish we had some champagne to
            wrap it around.

                         MRS. DREYFUSS
                   (to Fran)
            What did I tell you?

                         BUD
                   (uncomfortable)
            Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have
            to wait around. I'll wash the
            dishes and --

                         MRS. DREYFUSS
            You wash 'em, you break 'em. I'll
            come back for them later.
                   (to Fran)
            If he makes trouble, give me a yell.

She exits.

                         FRAN
            She doesn't seem to like you very
            much.

                         BUD
            Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of
            fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that
            anybody should think a girl like
            you -- would do a thing like
            this -- over a guy like me.

                         FRAN
                   (glancing at night table)
            Oh. Did you find something here --
            an envelope -- ?

                         BUD
            Yes, I've got it.
                   (takes envelope out
                   of back pocket)
            Don't you think we'd better destroy
            it? So it won't fall into the wrong
            hands -- ?

                         FRAN
            Open it.

Bud tears open the envelope, takes out Sheldrake's hundred
dollars.

                         BUD
            There's nothing here but a hundred
            dollar bill.

                         FRAN
            That's right. Will you see that Mr.
            Sheldrake gets it?

                         BUD
                   (shrugging)
            Sure.

He puts the money in his pocket.

                         FRAN
                   (holding out tray)
            Here -- take this, will you?

Bud relieves her of the tray, sets it down.

                         BUD
            You want me to move the television
            set in here?
                   (Fran shakes her head)
            You play gin rummy?

                         FRAN
            I'm not very good at it.

                         BUD
            I am. Let me get the cards.

                         FRAN
            You don't have to entertain me.

Bud opens the bureau drawer, takes out a deck of cards, a
score pad, and a pencil.

                         BUD
            Nothing I'd like better -- you know
            togetherness. Guess what I did last
            Christmas. Had an early dinner at
            the automat, then went to the zoo,
            then I came home and cleaned up
            after Mr. Eichelberger -- he had a
            little eggnog party here. I'm way
            ahead this year.

He pulls a chair up to the bed, starts to shuffle the cards.

                         BUD
            Three across, spades double, high
            deals.
                   (they cut)
            Eight -- ten.
                   (he starts to deal)


                         FRAN
                   (pensively)
            I think I'm going to give it all up.

                         BUD
            Give what up?

                         FRAN
            Why do people have to love people,
            anyway?

                         BUD
            Yeah -- I know what you mean.
                   (flips over down card)
            Queen.

                         FRAN
            I don't want it.

                         BUD
            Pick a card.

She does, and they start playing.

                         FRAN
            What do you call it when somebody
            keeps getting smashed up in
            automobile accidents?

                         BUD
            A bad insurance risk?

                         FRAN
                   (nodding)
            That's me with men. I've been
            jinxed from the word go -- first
            time I was ever kissed was in a
            cemetery.

                         BUD
            A cemetery?

                         FRAN
            I was fifteen -- we used to go
            there to smoke. His name was
            George -- he threw me over for a
            drum majorette.

                         BUD
            Gin.

He spreads his hand. Fran lays her cards down, and Bud adds
them up.

                         BUD
            Thirty-six and twenty-five --
            that's sixty-one and two boxes.
                   (enters score on pad)


                         FRAN
            I just have this talent for falling
            in love with the wrong guy in the
            wrong place at the wrong time.
                         BUD
                   (shuffling)
            How many guys were there?

                         FRAN
                   (holding up four fingers)
            Three. The last one was manager of
            a finance company, back home in
            Pittsburgh -- they found a little
            shortage in his accounts, but he
            asked me to wait for him -- he'll
            be out in 1965.

                         BUD
                   (pushing the deck
                   toward her)
            Cut.

                         FRAN
                   (she does, and he
                   starts dealing)
            So I came to New York and moved in
            with my sister and her husband --
            he drives a cab. They sent me to
            secretarial school, and I applied
            for a job with Consolidated - but I
            flunked the typing test --

                         BUD
            Too slow?

                         FRAN
            Oh. I can type up a storm, but I
            can't spell. So they gave me a pair
            of white gloves and stuck me in an
            elevator -- that's how I met
            Jeff --
                   (her eyes mist up,
                   and she puts her
                   cards down)
            Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am
            I going to do now?

                         BUD
            You better win a hand -- you're on
            a blitz.

                         FRAN
            Was he really upset when you told
            him?

                         BUD
            Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.

                         FRAN
            Maybe he does love me -- only he
            doesn't have the nerve to tell his
            wife.

                         BUD
            I'm sure that's the explanation.

                         FRAN
            You really think so?

                         BUD
            No doubt about it.

                         FRAN
                   (a thoughtful beat, then)
            Can I have that pad and the pencil?

                         BUD
                   (handing her score
                   pad and pencil)
            What for?

                         FRAN
            I'm going to write a letter to Mrs.
            Sheldrake.

                         BUD
            You are?

                         FRAN
            As one woman to another -- I'm sure
            she'll understand --

                         BUD
            Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's
            such a good idea.

He gently takes the pad and pencil away from her.

                         FRAN
            Why not?

                         BUD
            Well, for one thing, you can't
            spell. And secondly -- if you did
            something like that -- you'd hate
            yourself.

                         FRAN
                   (fighting back tears)
            I don't like myself very much anyway.

                         BUD
            Pick up your cards and let's go.

                         FRAN
            Do I have to?

                         BUD
            You bet. I got a terrific hand.

Fran, her eyes drooping sleepily, picks up her cards, makes
a discard.

                         BUD
            You sure you want to throw that card?

                         FRAN
            Sure.

                         BUD
            Gin.

He removes the cards from her hand, starts to add them up.

                         BUD
            Fifty-two and twenty-five -- that's
            seventy-seven -- spades is double --
            a hundred and fifty-four -- and
            four boxes -- you're blitzed in two
            games.

He enters the score on the pad. As he starts to shuffle
again, he notices that Fran has slid down on the pillow, and
that her eyes are closed -- she is asleep.

Bud rises, adjusts the blanket over her. He stands there
looking at her for a moment, runs his hand over his chin.
Realizing he needs a shave, he crosses to the bathroom.

In the bathroom, Bud washes his face, squirts some shaving
cream into his hand, starts to apply it.

EXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - DAY

A Volkswagen draws up to the curb in front of the house.
Kirkeby gets out on the street side, Sylvia squeezes herself
out through the other door. Kirkeby raises the front hood of
the Volkswagen, reaches into the luggage compartment, takes
out a cardboard bucket with a bottle of champagne on ice.
Together, he and Sylvia start up the steps of the house,
Sylvia already cha cha-ing in anticipation.

INT. APARTMENT - DAY

In the bathroom, Bud has just finished lathering his face
when the doorbell rings. He starts into the bedroom.

                         BUD
                   (muttering to himself)
            All right -- all right, Mrs.
            Dreyfuss.

He glances at the sleeping Fran, picks up the tray, carries
it into the living room, pulling the bedroom door closed
behind him. But it doesn't shut completely, because of
Fran's dress hooked over the top.

Bud crosses to the hall door, opens it. Outside are Kirkeby,
with the champagne bucket, and Sylvia.

                         KIRKEBY
            Hi, Baxter.

                         BUD
                   (blocking the door)
            What do you want?

                         KIRKEBY
            What do I -- ?
                   (to Sylvia)
            Just a minute.

He pushes his way into the apartment past Bud.

                         BUD
            You can't come in.

                         KIRKEBY
                   (closing the door
                   behind him)
            What's the matter with you, Buddy-
            boy? I made a reservation for four
            o'clock, remember?

He heads for the coffee table, sets the champagne down. Bud
shoots a quick glance toward the bedroom door, gets rid of
the tray.

                         BUD
            Look, you can't stay here. Just
            take your champagne and go.

                         KIRKEBY
            Baxter, I don't want to pull rank
            on you -- but I told the lady it
            was all set -- you want to make a
            liar out of me?

                         BUD
            Are you going to leave, Mr. Kirkeby,
            or do I have to throw you out?

As Bud spins him around, Kirkeby notices the dress on the
bedroom door.

                         KIRKEBY
            Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?
                   (indicating dress)
            You got yourself a little playmate,
            huh?

                         BUD
            Now will you get out?

INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - DAY

Outside the door of Bud's apartment, Sylvia is cha cha-ing
impatiently. Up the stairs comes Dr. Dreyfuss, in his
overcoat and carrying his medical bag.

                         SYLVIA
                   (knocking on the door)
            Hey, come on, what are we waiting
            for? Open up, will you?

She continues cha-cha-ing. Dr. Dreyfuss has unlocked the
door to his apartment, and is watching Sylvia, appalled by
the fact that Baxter seems to be at it again. He starts
inside.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (calling)
            Mildred --  !

He shuts the door behind him.

                         SYLVIA
                   (knocking on Baxter's door)
            What's holding things up?

INT. APARTMENT - DAY

Kirkeby looks toward the door in response to Sylvia's
knocking.

                         KIRKEBY
            Say, why don't we have ourselves a
            party -- the four of us?

                         BUD
            No!

He forces Kirkeby toward the hall door. Kirkeby, glancing
past him through the partly-open door of the bedroom,
catches sight of Fran asleep in bed.

                         KIRKEBY
                   (grinning smugly)
            Well, I don't blame you. So you hit
            the jackpot, eh kid -- I mean,
            Kubelik-wise?
                   (Bud opens the door,
                   gestures him out)
            Don't worry. I won't say a word to
            anybody.

INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - DAY

Kirkeby comes backing out the door of Bud's apartment, minus
the champagne bucket.

                         KIRKEBY
            Stay with it, Buddy-boy!
                   (Bud shuts the door
                   on him)
            Come on, Sylvia.

                         SYLVIA
            What gives?

                         KIRKEBY
            A little mixup in signals. Let's go.

                         SYLVIA
            Go where?

                         KIRKEBY
                   (leading her toward stairs)
            What's your mother doing this
            afternoon?

                         SYLVIA
            She's home -- stuffing a turkey.

                         KIRKEBY
            Why don't we send her to a movie --
            like Ben-Hur?

                         SYLVIA
            That's fine. But what are we going
            to do about grandma and Uncle
            Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two
            nieces --

INT. APARTMENT - DAY

Bud comes into the bedroom. As he heads for the bathroom,
Fran stirs slightly, opens her eyes.

                         FRAN
            Who was that?

                         BUD
            Just somebody delivering a bottle
            of champagne. Like some?

                         FRAN
                   (shaking her head)
            Would you mind opening the window?

She turns off the electric blanket as Bud crosses to the
window, pushes it up. Then a thought strikes him, and he
looks at Fran suspiciously.

                         BUD
            Now don't go getting any ideas,
            Miss Kubelik.

                         FRAN
            I just want some fresh air.

                         BUD
            It's only one story down -- the
            best you can do is break a leg.

                         FRAN
            So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.

                         BUD
                   (approaching the bed)
            Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to
            promise me you won't do anything
            foolish.

                         FRAN
            Who'd care?

                         BUD
            I would.

                         FRAN
                   (sleepily)
            Why can't I ever fall in love with
            somebody nice like you?

                         BUD
                   (ruefully)
            Yeah. Well -- that's the way it
            crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.

Fran closes her eyes. Bud returns to the bathroom, picks up
his razor, starts to shave. But something seems to be wrong
with the razor -- and unscrewing it, he realizes that there
is no blade. Sheepishly, he takes out the blade he hid in
his shirt pocket, inserts it in his razor, screws it shut.
Then he resumes shaving.

                                            FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

INT. SHELDRAKE'S ANTEROOM - DAY

It is the morning after Christmas, and Miss Olsen and the
other girls are just settling down to work. Sheldrake, in
hat and coat, approaches from the elevators, comes through
the glass doors.

                         SECRETARIES
                   (ad lib)
            Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (ignoring them)
            Miss Olsen, will you come into my
            office, please?

He strides into the inner office. Miss Olsen picks up her
stenographic pad, follows him in.

INT. SHELDRAKE'S OFFICE - DAY

Sheldrake is removing his hat and coat as Miss Olsen comes
in, shuts the door behind her.

                         MISS OLSEN
            Did you have a nice Christmas?

                         SHELDRAKE
            Lovely. You were a big help.

                         MISS OLSEN
            Me?
                         SHELDRAKE
            Thank you for giving that little
            pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the
            office party.

                         MISS OLSEN
                   (dropping her
                   business-like mask)
            I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could
            never hold my liquor --

                         SHELDRAKE
            But I thought you could hold your
            tongue.

                         MISS OLSEN
            It won't happen again.

                         SHELDRAKE
            You bet it won't. I'll arrange for
            you to get a month's severance
            pay --
                   (she looks at him, uncomprehending)
            That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm
            letting you go.

                         MISS OLSEN
                   (quietly)
            You let me go four years ago, Jeff.
            Only you were cruel enough to make
            me sit out there and watch the new
            models pass by.

                         SHELDRAKE
            I'd appreciate it if you'd be out
            of here as soon as you can.

                         MISS OLSEN
                   (formal again)
            Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

She turns and walks out of the office, shutting the door.
Sheldrake looks after her for a moment, then goes to his
desk, picks up the phone, dials the operator.

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (into phone)
            This is Mr. Sheldrake. I'd like Mr.
            Baxter's home telephone number --
            that's C.C. Baxter, in Ordinary
            Premium Accounting --

INT. SHELDRAKE'S ANTEROOM - DAY

Miss Olsen has put on her coat, and is going through her
desk drawers, cleaning out her personal belongings -- nail
polish, emery boards, an extra pair of glasses, etc. As she
stows them away in her handbag, one of the buttons on the
telephone lights up. Miss Olsen hesitates for a second, then
with a quick look around, she pushes the button down,
carefully picks up the receiver, listens in.

INT. SHELDRAKE'S OFFICE - DAY

Sheldrake is dialing the last two digits of a telephone
number. After a moment, someone answers.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Hello, Baxter? Jeff Sheldrake. Can
            you talk?

INT. THE APARTMENT - DAY

Bud, wearing slacks, a shirt open at the neck, and a cardigan
sweater, is at the phone. A pillow and a blanket on the
living room couch indicate where he spent the night.

                         BUD
                   (looking off)
            Yes, she's in the shower -- she's
            coming along fine, considering.

SHELDRAKE - ON PHONE

                         SHELDRAKE
            Good. Is there anything you need --
            money -- ?

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a
            matter of fact, I've got some money
            for you -- a hundred dollars --

SHELDRAKE - ON PHONE

                         SHELDRAKE
            Oh.
                   (a beat)
            Well, if there's anything I can do
            for you --

BUD - ON PHONE

                         BUD
            For me? I don't think so. But I was
            hoping maybe you could do something
            for her --

SHELDRAKE - ON PHONE

                         SHELDRAKE
            Like what? Put yourself in my
            place, Baxter -- how can I help
            her -- my hands are tied --

INT. APARTMENT - DAY

Fran now appears in the bedroom, wearing the plaid robe, and
toweling her damp hair.

                         BUD
                   (into phone)
            Well, at least you can talk to
            her -- let me put her on -- and
            please be gentle --

He puts the receiver down, crosses toward the bedroom door.

                         BUD
            There's a call for you --

                         FRAN
                   (approaching)
            For me?

                         BUD
            -- Mr. Sheldrake.

                         FRAN
            I don't want to talk to him.

                         BUD
            I think you should. I have to run
            down to the grocery anyway -- all
            that's left around here is one
            frozen pizza --
                   (takes raincoat and
                   old hat from hanger)
            I'll be right back -- okay?

Fran nods, watches him go out. Then she glances toward the
phone, which is off the hook. Reluctantly she advances
toward it, picks it up.

                         FRAN
                   (into phone)
            Hello, Jeff.
                   (a long beat)
            Yes, I'm all right.

SHELDRAKE - ON PHONE

                         SHELDRAKE
            Fran, why did you do it? It's so
            childish -- and it never solves
            anything -- I ought to be very
            angry with you, scaring me like
            that -- but let's forget the whole
            thing -- pretend it never
            happened -- what do you say, Fran?
                   (no answer)
            Fran --

INT. SHELDRAKE'S ANTEROOM

Miss Olsen, glued to the phone, is listening intently.

SHELDRAKE - ON PHONE

                         SHELDRAKE
            Are you there, Fran?

FRAN - ON PHONE

                         FRAN
            Of course I'm not here -- because
            the whole thing never happened -- I
            never took those pills -- I never
            loved you -- we never even met --
            isn't that the way you want it?

SHELDRAKE - ON PHONE

                         SHELDRAKE
            There you go again -- you know I
            didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just
            get well -- do what the nurse tells
            you -- I mean Baxter -- and I'll
            see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran.
                   (he hangs up)


INT. SHELDRAKE'S ANTEROOM - DAY

Miss Olsen hangs up the phone, sits there for a moment,
weighing what she has overheard. Then she makes a decision,
picks up the phone again, dials a number. As she waits for
an answer, she glances toward Sheldrake's office.
                         MISS OLSEN
                   (into phone)
            Hello, Mrs. Sheldrake? This is Miss
            Olsen -- fine, thank you -- Mrs.
            Sheldrake, I was wondering if we
            could have lunch together? -- well,
            I don't know how important it is,
            but I think you might find it
            educational -- it concerns your
            husband -- all right, one o'clock,
            at Longchamp's, Madison and 59th.

She looks up as the door to the inner office opens and
Sheldrake comes out. He stops when he sees that Miss Olsen
is still there.

                         MISS OLSEN
                   (hanging up phone)
            Don't worry, I'm on my way.
                   (she rises)
            I was just making a personal call.

She opens her handbag, takes out a coin, puts it down on the
desk.

                         MISS OLSEN
            Here's a dime.

She marches out through the glass doors toward the elevators
as Sheldrake stands there, watching her.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - DAY

Bud comes down the street, carrying a large brown paper bag
overflowing with groceries. He goes up the steps of the
house and through the front door.

INT. STAIRCASE AND SECOND FLOOR LANDING - DAY

As Bud starts up the stairs, with the groceries, Mrs.
Lieberman comes hurrying down toward him.

                         MRS. LIEBERMAN
                   (breathlessly)
            Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're
            here -- I was just going to get the
            passkey.

                         BUD
            What for?

                         MRS. LIEBERMAN
            I thought I smelled gas coming from
            your apartment.

                         BUD
            Gas?

He races up the stairs two at a time, fumbling frantically
for his key. Reaching the door of his apartment, he unlocks
it, dashes in.

INT. THE APARTMENT - DAY

Bud comes bursting through the door. The living room is
empty, and the bedclothes have been removed from the couch.

                         BUD
                   (calling)
            Miss Kubelik!

He dumps the bag of groceries on a table, rushes into the
kitchen. The burner has been turned on under the kettle, but
there is no flame, and gas is hissing from the vents. Bud
snaps it off, starts out again.

                         BUD
            Miss Kubelik!

Meanwhile Fran has appeared from the bathroom, and is
approaching the bedroom door. She is still in her robe, and
is holding a double sock-stretcher with one of Bud's socks
on it. Bud, rounding the corner from the kitchen at full
speed, collides with Fran in the bedroom doorway. He grabs
her arms with obvious relief.

                         BUD
            Are you all right?

                         FRAN
            Sure.
                   (sniffs)
            What's that funny smell?

                         BUD
            Gas.
                   (indicating kitchen)
            Didn't you turn it on?

                         FRAN
            Yes. I was boiling some water to
            get the coffee stains out of my
            dress.

                         BUD
                   (accusingly)
            You turned it on -- but you didn't
            light it.

                         FRAN
            Are you supposed to?

                         BUD
            In this house, you're supposed to.

                         FRAN
            Oh.

Bud starts to take off his hat and coat, notices the sock-
stretcher in her hand.

                         BUD
            What are you doing with that?

                         FRAN
            I was washing my stockings, so I
            decided I might as well do your
            socks.

                         BUD
            Thank you.

                         FRAN
            It's very curious -- I could only
            find three and a half pair.

                         BUD
            Well, things are a little
            disorganized around here.

He carries the bag of groceries into the kitchen, Fran
trailing after him. During the following, he removes the
contents of the bag -- bread, eggs, bacon, spaghetti, ground
round, frankfurters, and assorted canned goods -- sets them
out on the drainboard.

                         FRAN
            I'd say. What's a tennis racquet
            doing in the kitchen?

She produces the racquet from behind the stove.

                         BUD
            Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I
            was cooking myself an Italian
            dinner.
                   (Fran looks at him oddly)
            I used it to strain the spaghetti.
                         FRAN
                   (thinking it over)
            Why not?

                         BUD
            As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty
            good cook -- but I'm a lousy
            housekeeper.

                         FRAN
            Yes, you are,
                   (indicating the
                   living room)
            When I was straightening up the
            couch, you know what I found? Six
            hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of
            false eyelashes, and a swizzle
            stick from the Stork Club.

                         BUD
                   (shrugging)
            It's just that I'm the kind of guy
            who can't say no -- I don't mean to
            girls -- I mean --

                         FRAN
            You mean to someone like Mr.
            Sheldrake.

                         BUD
            I guess so.

                         FRAN
            I know so. He's a taker.

                         BUD
            A what?

                         FRAN
            Some people take, some people get
            took -- and they know they're
            getting took -- and there's nothing
            they can do about it.

                         BUD
            I wouldn't say that --
                   (trying to change the subject)
            What would you like to have for
            diner? There's onion soup and
            canned asparagus --

                         FRAN
            I really ought to be getting home.
            My family will be flipping by now.

She starts into the living room. Bud follows her.

                         BUD
            You can't leave yet. The doctor
            says it takes forty-eight hours to
            get the stuff out of your system.

                         FRAN
                   (wistfully)
            I wonder how long it takes to get
            someone you're stuck on out of your
            system? If they'd only invent some
            kind of a pump for that --

She sits on the arm of a chair.

                         BUD
            I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik.
            You think it's the end of the
            world -- but it's not, really. I
            went through exactly the same thing
            myself.

                         FRAN
            You did?

                         BUD
            Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried
            to do it with a gun.

                         FRAN
            Over a girl?

                         BUD
            Worse than that -- she was the wife
            of my best friend -- and I was mad
            for her. But I knew it was
            hopeless -- so I decided to end it
            all. I went to a pawnshop and
            bought a forty-five automatic and
            drove up to Eden Park -- do you
            know Cincinnati?

                         FRAN
            No, I don't.

                         BUD
            Anyway, I parked the car and loaded
            the gun -- well, you read in the
            papers all the time that people
            shoot themselves, but believe me,
            it's not that easy -- I mean, how
            do you do it? -- here, or here, or
            here --
                   (with cocked finger,
                   he points to his
                   temple, mouth and chest)
            -- you know where I finally shot
            myself?

                         FRAN
            Where?

                         BUD
                   (indicating kneecap)
            Here.

                         FRAN
            In the knee?

                         BUD
            Uh-huh. While I was sitting there,
            trying to make my mind up, a cop
            stuck his head in the car, because
            I was illegally parked -- so I
            started to hide the gun under the
            seat and it went off -- pow!

                         FRAN
                   (laughing)
            That's terrible.

                         BUD
            Yeah. Took me a year before I could
            bend my knee -- but I got over the
            girl in three weeks. She still
            lives in Cincinnati, has four kids,
            gained twenty pounds -- she sends
            me a fruit cake every Christmas.

                         FRAN
                   (suddenly suspicious)
            Are you just making that up to make
            me feel better?

                         BUD
            Of course not. Here's the fruit
            cake.
                   (shows it to her
                   under Christmas tree)
            And you want to see my knee?
                   (starts to raise
                   pant-leg)


                         FRAN
            No, thanks. The fellows in the
            office may get the wrong idea how I
            found out.

                         BUD
            So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook
            dinner for us. We'll have the fruit
            cake for dessert. You just sit
            there and rest. You've done enough
            for one day.

                         FRAN
                   (smiling)
            Yes, nurse.

Bud starts happily into the kitchen.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LOBBY INSURANCE BUILDING - DAY

It is mid-afternoon, and traffic is light. A Yellow Cab has
pulled up in front of the entrance, and the driver, a
stockily-built young man in a leather jacket and cap, gets
out and comes through the revolving doors into the lobby.
His name is KARL MATUSCHKA, and he is Fran's brother-in-law.
As he cases the elevators, the starter comes up to him.

                         ELEVATOR STARTER
            Can I help you?

                         MATUSCHKA
            I'm looking for one of the elevator
            girls -- Miss Kubelik.

                         ELEVATOR STARTER
            So am I. She didn't report this
            morning.

                         MATUSCHKA
            She didn't. Where can I get some
            information -- who's in charge here?
                         ELEVATOR STARTER
            That comes under General Office
            Administration. See Mr. Dobisch,
            twenty-first floor.

                         MATUSCHKA
            Thanks.

He steps into an elevator, the doors of which are just
closing.

INT. DOBISCH'S OFFICE - DAY

Dobisch is sitting behind his desk, lighting a cigar.
Kirkeby, who has dropped in for a little visit, is perched
on the edge of the desk.

                         KIRKEBY
            -- so yesterday afternoon I take
            Sylvia up to the apartment, and
            guess who he's got stashed away in
            the bedroom?

                         DOBISCH
            Who?

                         KIRKEBY
            Kubelik.

                         DOBISCH
            No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik
            having themselves a little toot!

                         KIRKEBY
            Toot? It's more like a lost weekend.
            Neither of them showed up for work
            today.

                         DOBISCH
            A.W.O.L.?

                         KIRKEBY
            What gripes me is the two of them
            were guzzling my champagne while
            Sylvia and I wound up at the
            Guggenheim Museum.

The glass door opens and Matuschka comes in.

                         MATUSCHKA
            Mr. Dobisch?

                         DOBISCH
            Yeah.

                         MATUSCHKA
            My name is Karl Matuschka -- my
            sister-in-law, she runs one of the
            elevators here -- Fran Kubelik.

                         KIRKEBY
                   (exchanging a glance
                   with Dobisch)
            Miss Kubelik?

                         MATUSCHKA
            You know her?

                         DOBISCH
            Of course. There may be a lot of
            employees here -- but we're one big
            happy family.

                         MATUSCHKA
            Well, she lives with us -- and my
            wife, she's getting a little
            nervous -- on account of Fran
            hasn't been home for two days.

                         KIRKEBY
                   (another look at Dobisch)
            That so.

                         MATUSCHKA
            Anyway, we was wondering if somebody
            in the office would know what
            happened to her.

                         DOBISCH
            I see.
                   (to Kirkeby)
            What do you think, Al? Can we help
            the man?

                         KIRKEBY
                   (after a pregnant pause)
            Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy
            anything.

                         DOBISCH
            Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us
            lately?

                         MATUSCHKA
                   (scowling)
            Who is Buddy-boy?

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. THE APARTMENT - EVENING

Buddy-boy is bending over a hot stove, preparing an Italian
dinner. He takes a saucepan of spaghetti off the fire, and
picking up the tennis racquet with the other hand, pours the
spaghetti on top of the racquet strings. Then he turns on
the faucet, runs water over the spaghetti. With the combined
technique of Brillat-Savarin and Pancho Gonzales, he gently
agitates the racquet, letting the water drain off the
spaghetti. As he works, he hums a theme from Tschaikowsky's
Capriccio Italien.

Fran walks in, still in her robe.

                         FRAN
            Are we dressing for dinner?

                         BUD
            No -- just come as you are.

                         FRAN
                   (watching him)
            Say, you're pretty good with that
            racquet.

                         BUD
            You ought to see my backhand.
                   (dumping spaghetti
                   into platter)
            And wait till I serve the meatballs.
                   (demonstrates)


                         FRAN
            Shall I light the candles?

                         BUD
            It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.

As Fran starts into the living room, Bud begins to ladle
meat sauce onto the spaghetti, humming operatically.

In the living room, the small table has been set for two,
and prominent on it is the champagne bottle that Mr. Kirkeby
left behind, still in its cardboard bucket, but freshly iced.
As Fran lights the candles, she notices the napkins on the
table, peels a price-tag off the corner of one of them.

                         FRAN
            I see you bought some napkins.

                         BUD
            Might as well go all the way.

He carries the platter of spaghetti and meat sauce in from
the kitchen, sets it on the table, sprinkles some cheese on
it. Then he crosses to the coffee table, where a full
martini pitcher stands in readiness, fills a couple of
glasses. Fran seats herself at the table.

                         BUD
            You know, I used to live like
            Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked
            among eight million people. Then
            one day I saw a footprint in the
            sand -- and there you were --
                   (hands her martini)
            It's a wonderful thing -- dinner
            for two.

                         FRAN
            You usually eat alone?

                         BUD
            Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner
            with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with
            Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the
            other night I had dinner with Mae
            West -- of course, she was much
            younger then.
                   (toasting)
            Cheers.

                         FRAN
            Cheers.

They drink.

                         BUD
            You know what we're going to do
            after dinner?

                         FRAN
            The dishes?

                         BUD
            I mean, after that?

                         FRAN
            What?

                         BUD
            You don't have to if you don't want
            to --

                         FRAN
            I don't?

                         BUD
            We're going to finish that gin game.

                         FRAN
            Oh.

                         BUD
            So I want you to keep a clear head.

The door bell rings. Carrying his martini glass, Bud crosses
to the door, starts to open it.

                         BUD
            Because I don't want to take
            advantage of you -- the way I did
            yesterday in bed.

By now the door is open, and Bud is speaking to Fran over
his shoulder. He turns, finds himself face to face with Karl
Matuschka, who is standing grimly in the doorway.

                         MATUSCHKA
            Baxter?

                         BUD
            Yes?

Matuschka shoves him roughly aside, strides past him toward
Fran, who has risen to her feet.

                         MATUSCHKA
            What's with you, Fran -- did you
            forget where you live?

                         FRAN
                   (to Bud)
            This is my brother-in-law, Karl
            Matuschka.

                         BUD
                   (friendly)
            How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?

                         MATUSCHKA
                   (pushing Bud away; to Fran)
            Okay, get your clothes on. I got
            the cab downstairs.

                         BUD
            Now, wait a minute. I know what
            you're thinking -- but it's not as
            bad as it looks --
                         MATUSCHKA
                   (shoving him away)
            It's none of my business what you
            do, Fran -- you're over twenty-
            one -- but your sister happens to
            think you're a lady.

                         BUD
            All we were going to do is eat and
            wash the dishes --

                         MATUSCHKA
                   (grabbing him)
            Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't
            a lady present, I'd clobber you.

                         FRAN
                   (separating them)
            All right, Karl -- I'll get dressed.

She exits into the bedroom, removing her dress from the
door, and closing it. Matuschka leans against the wall
beside the hall door, eyeing Bud truculently. Bud raises a
finger to remonstrate with him -- then breaks into a nervous,
ingratiating smile.

                         BUD
            Care for a martini? Champagne?
                   (Matuschka continues
                   glaring at him)
            How about a little spaghetti with
            meat sauce? Made it myself.
                   (Matuschka just scowls)
            Your sister-in-law sure is
            terrific --
                   (realizes his mistake;
                   switching abruptly)
            Must be murder driving a cab in New
            York -- I mean, with all that
            cross-town traffic --

He gestures with the martini glass, spilling the contents
over his shirtfront. Through the partly open hall door, Dr.
Dreyfuss sticks his head in.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Hi, Baxter.

He steps into the apartment, passing Matuschka without
seeing him.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            How's the patient?

                         BUD
                   (quickly)
            Oh, I'm fine, Doc.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Not you -- Miss Kubelik.

                         MATUSCHKA
                   (stepping forward)
            What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?

                         BUD
            Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's
            Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab
            downstairs --

                         MATUSCHKA
                   (to Dreyfuss)
            Fran been sick or something?

Dr. Dreyfuss looks at Bud.

                         BUD
            No, no -- just had a little accident.

                         MATUSCHKA
                   (to Dreyfuss)
            What does he mean, accident?

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Well, these things happen all the
            time --

                         MATUSCHKA
            What things?
                   (grabbing Dreyfuss)
            Say, what kind of doctor are you,
            anyway?

                         BUD
                   (hastily)
            Oh, not that kind. He just gave her
            a shot and pumped her stomach out --

Behind them, the bedroom door has opened, and Fran comes
out, wearing her coat over her dress.

                         MATUSCHKA
            What for?

                         FRAN
                   (coming up)
            Because I took some sleeping pills.
            But I'm all right now -- so let's go.

                         MATUSCHKA
            Why did you take sleeping pills?

                         BUD
                   (promptly)
            On account of me.

                         MATUSCHKA
                   (whirling on him)
            You?

                         BUD
            Who else?

Matuschka lashes out with a left to Bud's jaw, and while he
is off balance, catches him with a right to the eye. Bud
falls back against the Christmas tree, which topples with a
crash. Fran pulls Matuschka away from him.

                         FRAN
            Leave him alone, Karl.

She kneels beside Bud.

                         FRAN
                   (tenderly)
            You fool -- you damn fool.

                         MATUSCHKA
            Come on, Fran.

                         FRAN
            Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.

She kisses him on the cheek, rises, starts toward the door.

                         FRAN
            Goodbye, doctor.

She follows Matuschka out. Bud looks after her, starry-eyed.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            I don't want to gloat, but just
            between us, you had that coming to
            you.
                   (tilts Bud's chin up,
                   examines his eye)
            Tch, tch, tch. Are you going to
            have a shiner tomorrow. Let me get
            my bag.
                   (he starts out)
                         BUD
                   (calling after him)
            Don't bother, Doc. It doesn't hurt
            a bit.

He is on Cloud Nine.

                                            FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

INT. NINETEENTH FLOOR - DAY

Bud is coming from the elevators toward his office. He is
wearing his chesterfield, bowler, and a pair of dark glasses.
He opens the office door, starts in.

INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

Bud crosses directly to the phone, removes his glasses
revealing a swollen left eye. He dials a number.

                         BUD
                   (into phone)
            Mr. Sheldrake's office? This is C.C.
            Baxter. Would you please tell Mr.
            Sheldrake I'd like to come up and
            see him? It's rather important.
            Will you call me back, please?

He hangs up, takes off his hat and coat, deposits them on
the clothes- tree. Then he paces around the office,
rehearsing a speech out loud.

                         BUD
            Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news
            for you. All your troubles are over.
            I'm going to take Miss Kubelik off
            your hands.
                   (nods to himself with satisfaction)
            The plain fact is, Mr. Sheldrake,
            that I love her. I haven't told her
            yet, but I thought you should be
            the first to know. After all, you
            don't really want her, and I do,
            and although it may sound
            presumptuous, she needs somebody
            like me. So I think it would be the
            thing all around --
                   (the phone rings and
                   he picks it up)
            -- solution-wise.
                   (into phone)
            Yes? I'll be right up.

He hangs up, crosses to the door, opens it.

                         BUD
                   (to himself)
            Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news
            for you --

Putting on his dark glasses, he heads for the elevators,
still talking to himself.

INT. NINETEENTH FLOOR - DAY

Kirkeby and Dobisch are just stepping out of an elevator
when Bud approaches. They grin smugly when they see that he
is wearing dark glasses.

                         KIRKEBY
            Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?

                         DOBISCH
            Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a
            Yellow Cab?

Bud pays no attention, walks right past them into the
elevator, still muttering to himself. The doors close.

                         KIRKEBY
                   (as they move away
                   from the elevators)
            That guy really must've belted him.

                         DOBISCH
            Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to
            himself.

INT. TWENTY-SEVENTH FLOOR FOYER - DAY

The elevator doors open.

                         ELEVATOR OPERATOR
            Twenty-seven.

Bud steps out. As he heads for Sheldrake's office, he
continues rehearsing his speech.

                         BUD
            You see, Mr. Sheldrake, those two
            days she spent in the apartment --
            it made me realize how lonely I'd
            been before. But thanks to you, I'm
            in a financial position to marry
            her -- if I can ever square things
            with her family.

He opens the door to Sheldrake's anteroom.

INT. SHELDRAKE'S OFFICE - DAY

Sheldrake is pacing in front of his desk. A couple of
suitcases are standing in a corner of the room. The intercom
buzzes, and Sheldrake presses the lever down.

                         SECRETARY'S VOICE
            Mr. Baxter is here.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Send him in.

A beat, then the door opens, and Bud marches in determinedly.

                         BUD
            Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news
            for you --

                         SHELDRAKE
            And I've got good news for you,
            Baxter. All your troubles are over.

                         BUD
                   (reacting to the echo)
            Sir?

                         SHELDRAKE
            I know how worried you were about
            Miss Kubelik -- well, stop
            worrying -- I'm going to take her
            off your hands.

                         BUD
                   (stunned)
            You're going to take her off my
            hands?

                         SHELDRAKE
            That's right.
                   (indicating suitcases)
            I've moved out of my house -- I'm
            going to be staying in town, at the
            Athletic Club.

                         BUD
            You left your wife?

                         SHELDRAKE
            Well, if you must know -- I fired
            my secretary, my secretary got to
            my wife, and my wife fired me.
            Ain't that a kick in the head?

                         BUD
            Yeah --

                         SHELDRAKE
            Now what was your news, Baxter?

                         BUD
                   (recovering with difficulty)
            It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's
            all right again -- so she went back
            home.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Swell. And don't think I've
            forgotten what you did for me.
                   (opens door to
                   adjoining office)
            This way, Baxter.

Bud advances slowly toward the door.

INT. ADJOINING OFFICE - DAY

It is a slightly smaller and less lavish edition of Sheldrake
s office. Sheldrake ushers Bud through the door, points to
the chair behind the desk.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Sit down. Try it on for size.

Bud obeys like an automaton, lowers himself into the chair.

                         SHELDRAKE
            You like?
                   (indicating office)
            It's all yours.

                         BUD
            Mine?

                         SHELDRAKE
            My assistant, Roy Thompson, has
            been shifted to the Denver office,
            and you're taking his place.
                   (no reaction from Bud)
            What's the matter, Baxter? You
            don't seem very excited.

                         BUD
            Well, it's just that so many things
            have been happening so fast -- I'm
            very pleased -- especially for Miss
            Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to
            know her better, I think she's the
            kind of girl that definitely ought
            to be married to somebody --

                         SHELDRAKE
            Oh, sure, sure. But first the
            property settlement has to be
            worked out -- then it takes six
            weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm
            going to enjoy being a bachelor for
            a while.
                   (starts back toward
                   his own office)
            Oh, by the way, you can now have
            lunch in the executive dining
            room --

                         BUD
            Yes, sir.

He removes his dark glasses reflectively.

                         SHELDRAKE
            That's just one of the privileges
            that goes with this job. You also
            get a nice little expense account,
            the use of the executive washroom --
                   (breaks off, peers at
                   Bud's face)
            Say, what happened to you, Baxter?

                         BUD
            I got kicked in the head, too.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Oh?

With a shrug, he exits into his own office, closing the door
behind him. Bud sits there, unconsciously bending the
glasses in his hand until they suddenly snap in two. Bud
glances down at the two broken halves, as though surprised
by his own violence, tosses them on the desk.

INT. LOBBY INSURANCE BUILDING - EVENING

We are close on the building directory. Listed under
PERSONNEL is J.D. SHELDRAKE, Director, and just below that a man's
hand is inserting the name C.C. BAXTER in the slot marked Asst.
Director. The lettering is complete except for the final R.

Camera pulls back to reveal the sign painter we saw earlier,
working on the directory. Watching him is Bud. He is wearing
his chesterfield and bowler, and still has a slight welt
under his left eye. It is after six o'clock, and there is
very little activity in the lobby.

Fran, wearing her coat over street clothes, approaches from
the direction of the elevators, stops when she sees Bud.

                         FRAN
            Good evening, Mr. Baxter.

Bud turns to her in surprise, removes his bowler.

                         BUD
            Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?

                         FRAN
            Fine. How's your eye?

                         BUD
            Fine.

There is a moment of constraint between them.

                         FRAN
            How's everything at the apartment?

                         BUD
            Nothing's changed. You know, we
            never finished that gin game --

                         FRAN
            I know.
                   (a beat)
            I suppose you heard about Mr.
            Sheldrake --?

                         BUD
            You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah.
            I'm very happy for you.

                         FRAN
            I never thought he'd do it.

                         BUD
            I told you all along. You see, you
            were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.

                         FRAN
            I guess so.

                         BUD
            For that matter, you were wrong
            about me, too. What you said about
            those who take and those who get
            took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't
            using me -- I was using him. See?
                   (indicating his name
                   on directory)
            Last month I was at desk 861 on the
            nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the
            twenty-seventh floor, paneled
            office, three windows -- so it all
            worked out fine -- we're both
            getting what we want.

                         FRAN
            Yes.
                   (looks at her watch)
            You walking to the subway?

                         BUD
            No, thank you.
                   (fumbling)
            I -- well, to tell you the truth --
                   (glancing around lobby)
            -- I have this heavy date for
            tonight --

He points off toward the newsstand. Standing there is a
tall, attractive brunette, obviously waiting for someone.
Fran looks off in the indicated direction.

                         FRAN
            Oh.

                         BUD
            Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?

                         FRAN
            No. You know how people talk. So I
            decided it would be better if we
            didn't see each other till
            everything is settled, divorce-wise.

                         BUD
            That's very wise.

                         FRAN
            Good night, Mr. Baxter.

                         BUD
            Good night, Miss Kubelik.

Fran walks toward the revolving doors. Bud watches her for a
moment, then strides briskly across the lobby toward the
newsstand. He goes right past the waiting brunette, stops in
front of a rack of pocket books, examines the merchandise. A
man now comes out of a phone booth, joins the waiting
brunette, and they go off together. Bud picks out a couple
of paperbacks, pays the clerk behind the counter. Stuffing a
book into each coat pocket, he moves slowly toward the
revolving doors.

INT. SHELDRAKE'S OFFICE - DAY

Sheldrake is swiveled around sideways behind his desk, with
a bootblack kneeling in front of him, shining his shoes.
Reaching for the intercom, Sheldrake presses down one of the
levers.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Baxter -- would you mind stepping
            in her for a minute?

                         BAXTER'S VOICE
            Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

The bootblack finishes the second shoe with a flourish,
gathers up his equipment. Sheldrake tosses him a half dollar.

                         BOOTBLACK
            Much obliged.

He exits into the anteroom as the door of the adjoining
office opens and Bud comes in, carrying several charts.
There is no trace left of his black eye.

                         BUD
                   (putting charts on desk)
            Here's the breakdown of figures on
            personnel turnover. Thirty-seven
            percent of our female employees
            leave to get married, twenty-two
            percent quit because --

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (breaking in)
            You're working too hard, Baxter.
            It's New Year's Eve -- relax.

                         BUD
            Yes, sir.

                         SHELDRAKE
            I suppose you'll be on the town
            tonight -- celebrating?

                         BUD
            Naturally.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik
            out -- I finally talked her into
            it --

                         BUD
            I see.

                         SHELDRAKE
            The only thing is I'm staying at
            the Athletic Club -- and it's
            strictly stag so if you don't
            mind --

                         BUD
            Don't mind what?

                         SHELDRAKE
            You know that other key to your
            apartment -- well, when we had that
            little scare about Miss Kubelik, I
            thought I'd better get rid of it
            quick -- so I threw it out the
            window of the commuter train.

                         BUD
            Very clever.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Now I'll have to borrow your key.

                         BUD
            Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.

                         SHELDRAKE
            What do you mean, sorry?

                         BUD
            You're not going to bring anybody
            up to my apartment.

                         SHELDRAKE
            I'm not just bringing anybody --
            I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.

                         BUD
            Especially not Miss Kubelik.

                         SHELDRAKE
            How's that again?

                         BUD
                   (flatly)
            No key!

                         SHELDRAKE
            Baxter, I picked you for my team
            because I thought you were a bright
            young man. You realize what you're
            doing? Not to me -- but to yourself.
            Normally it takes years to work
            your way up to the twenty-seventh
            floor -- but it takes only thirty
            seconds to be out on the street
            again. You dig?

                         BUD
                   (nodding slowly)
            I dig.

                         SHELDRAKE
            So what's it going to be?

Without taking his eyes off Sheldrake, Bud reaches into his
pocket, fishes out a key, drops it on the desk.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Now you're being bright?

                         BUD
            Thank you, sir.

He turns abruptly, starts back into his own office.

INT. BUD'S NEW OFFICE - DAY

Bud comes in, shutting the door behind him, stands rooted to
the spot for a moment. Then he takes some pencils out of his
breast pocket and drops them into a container on the desk,
closes his account book, slams a couple of open file drawers
shut.

As he crosses to the clothes closet, the connecting door
opens and Sheldrake comes in, key in hand.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Say, Baxter -- you gave me the
            wrong key.

                         BUD
            No I didn't.

                         SHELDRAKE
                   (holding it out)
            But this is the key to the executive
            washroom.

                         BUD
            That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I
            won't be needing it -- because I'm
            all washed up around here.

He has taken his chesterfield and bowler out of the closet,
and is putting the coat on.

                         SHELDRAKE
            What's gotten into you, Baxter?

                         BUD
            Just following doctor's orders.
            I've decided to become a mensch.
            You know what that means? A human
            being.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Now hold on, Baxter --

                         BUD
            Save it. The old payola won't work
            any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

He opens the door to the anteroom, starts out.

INT. SHELDRAKE'S ANTEROOM - DAY

Bud comes out of his office, carrying his bowler, strides
past the secretaries and through the glass doors to the
foyer. An elevator is just unloading, and beside it a
handyman is cleaning out one of the cigarette receptacles.
Bud crosses to the elevator, and as he passes the handyman,
he jams his bowler on the man's head -- surrendering his
crown, so to speak. The elevator doors close. The handyman
straightens up, looks around in bewilderment.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. THE APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bud is in the process of packing. In the middle of the
living room are several large cardboard cartons filled with
his possessions. The art posters are off the walls, the
bric-a-brac has been removed from the shelves, and Bud is
stowing away the last of his books and records. He crosses
to the fireplace, opens one of the drawers in the cabinet
above it, takes out a forty-five automatic. He holds the gun
in the palm of his hand, studies it appraisingly.

The doorbell rings. Bud snaps out of his reverie, drops the
gun into one of the cartons, goes to the door and opens it.
Standing outside is Dr. Dreyfuss, with a plastic ice bucket
in his hand.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Say, Baxter -- we're having a
            little party and we ran out of
            ice -- so I was wondering --

                         BUD
            Sure, Doc.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (stepping inside)
            How come you're alone on New Year's
            Eve?

                         BUD
            Well, I have things to do --

                         DR. DREYFUSS
                   (noticing cartons)
            What's this -- you packing?

                         BUD
            Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.

He goes into the kitchen, opens the refrigerator, starts to
pry out the ice-cube trays.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Where are you moving to?

                         BUD
            I don't know. All I know is I got
            to get out of this place.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Sorry to lose you, Baxter.

                         BUD
            Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't
            worry, Doc -- it'll go to the
            University -- I'll put it in
            writing --

He dumps the ice-cubes, still in their trays, into the
bucket Dr. Dreyfuss is holding. Then he pulls Kirkeby's
unopened bottle of champagne out of the refrigerator.

                         BUD
            Can you use a bottle of champagne?

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Booze we don't need. Why don't you
            join us, Baxter? We got two brain
            surgeons, an ear, nose and throat
            specialist, a proctologist, and
            three nurses from Bellevue.

                         BUD
            No, thanks -- I don't feel like it.
            Look, Doc -- in case I don't see
            you again -- how much do I owe you
            for taking care of that girl?

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Forget it -- I didn't do it as a
            doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.
                   (stopping in doorway)
            By the way, whatever happened to her?

                         BUD
                   (airily)
            You know me with girls. Easy come,
            easy go. Goodbye, Doc.

                         DR. DREYFUSS
            Happy New Year.

Bud closes the door, returns to the kitchen, brings out a
box of glassware and the tennis racquet. As he starts to
deposit the racquet in a carton, he notices a strand of
spaghetti clinging to the strings. He removes it gently,
stands there twirling the limp spaghetti absently around his
finger.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

It is five minutes before midnight, New Year's Eve. Sitting
alone in the last booth is Fran, a paper hat on her head, a
pensive look on her face. There are two champagne glasses on
the table, and the usual noisemakers, but the chair opposite
her is empty. Above the general hubbub, the Chinese pianist
can be heard playing. After a moment, Fran glances off.

Threading his way through the merrymakers crowding the bar
and overflowing from the booths is Sheldrake. He is in
dinner clothes, topped by a paper hat. Reaching the last
booth, he drops into the chair facing Fran.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Sorry it took me so long on the
            phone. But we're all set.

                         FRAN
            All set for what?

                         SHELDRAKE
            I rented a car -- it's going to be
            here at one o'clock -- we're
            driving to Atlantic City.

                         FRAN
            Atlantic City?

                         SHELDRAKE
            I know it's a drag -- but you can't
            find a hotel room in town -- not on
            New Year's Eve.

                         FRAN
                   (a long look at Sheldrake)
            Ring out the old year, ring in the
            new. Ring-a-ding-ding.

                         SHELDRAKE
            I didn't plan it this way, Fran --
            actually, it's all Baxter's fault.

                         FRAN
            Baxter?

                         SHELDRAKE
            He wouldn't give me the key to the
            apartment.

                         FRAN
            He wouldn't.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Just walked out on me -- quit --
            threw that big fat job right in my
            face.

                         FRAN
                   (a faint smile)
            The nerve.

                         SHELDRAKE
            That little punk -- after all I did
            for him! He said I couldn't bring
            anybody to his apartment --
            especially not Miss Kubelik. What's
            he got against you, anyway?

                         FRAN
                   (a faraway look in
                   her eye)
            I don't know. I guess that's the
            way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.

                         SHELDRAKE
            What are you talking about?

                         FRAN
            I'd spell it out for you -- only I
            can't spell.

The piano player is consulting the watch on his upraised
left arm. He drops the arm in a signal, and the lights go
out. At the same time, he strikes up AULD LANG SYNE.

All over the dimly lit room, couples get to their feet,
embracing and joining in the song.

In the last booth, Sheldrake leans across the table, kisses
Fran.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Happy New Year, Fran.

Fran's expression is preoccupied. Sheldrake faces in the
direction of the pianist, and holding his glass aloft, sings
along with the others.

As AULD LANG SYNE comes to an end, the place explodes
noisily -- there is a din of horns, ratchets, and shouted
greetings. The lights come up again.

In the last booth, Sheldrake turns back toward Fran -- but
she is no longer there. Her paper hat lies abandoned on her
vacated chair.

                         SHELDRAKE
            Fran --
                   (looking around)
            -- where are you, Fran?

He rises, cranes his neck, trying to spot her in the crowd.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT

Fran, a coat thrown over the dress she was wearing at the
Rickshaw, comes down the street almost at a run. There is a
happy, expectant look on her face. She hurries up the steps
of the house and through the front door.

INT. STAIRCASE AND SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

Fran mounts the stairs eagerly. As she reaches the landing
and heads for Bud's apartment, there is a loud, sharp report
from inside.

Fran freezes momentarily, then rushes to the door.

                         FRAN
            Mr. Baxter!
                   (pounding on door)
            Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!

The door opens and there stands Bud, the bottle of champagne
he has just uncorked still foaming over in his hand. He
stares at Fran unbelievingly.

                         FRAN
                   (sagging with relief)
            Are you all right?

                         BUD
            I'm fine.

                         FRAN
            Are you sure? How's your knee?

                         BUD
            I'm fine all over.

                         FRAN
            Mind if I come in?

                         BUD
                   (still stunned)
            Of course not.

INT. THE APARTMENT - NIGHT

Fran comes in and Bud shuts the door. The room is the same
as we left it, except for an empty champagne glass standing
on the coffee table.

                         BUD
            Let me get another glass.

He goes to one of the cartons, takes out a champagne glass
wrapped in newspaper, starts to unwrap it.

                         FRAN
                   (looking around)
            Where are you going?
                         BUD
            Who knows? Another neighborhood --
            another town -- another job -- I'm
            on my own.

                         FRAN
            That's funny -- so am I.
                   (Bud, pouring
                   champagne, looks up
                   at her)
            What did you do with the cards?

                         BUD
                   (indicating carton)
            In there.

Fran takes the deck of cards and the gin rummy score pad out
of the carton, settles herself on the couch, starts to
shuffle the cards expertly.

                         BUD
            What about Mr. Sheldrake?

                         FRAN
            I'm going to send him a fruit cake
            every Christmas.

Bud sinks down happily on the couch, and Fran holds out the
deck to him.

                         FRAN
            Cut.

Bud cuts a card, but doesn't look at it.

                         BUD
            I love you, Miss Kubelik.

                         FRAN
                   (cutting a card)
            Seven --
                   (looking at Bud's card)
            -- queen.

She hands the deck to Bud.

                         BUD
            Did you hear what I said, Miss
            Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.

                         FRAN
                   (smiling)
            Shut up and deal!

Bud begins to deal, never taking his eyes off her. Fran
removes her coat, starts picking up her cards and arranging
them. Bud, a look of pure joy on his face, deals -- and
deals -- and keeps dealing.

And that's about it. Story-wise.

EXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT, LAS VEGAS, 1983 - DAY

SAM 'ACE' ROTHSTEIN, a tall, lean, immaculately dressed man 
approaches his car, opens the door, and gets inside to turn 
on the ignition.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          When you love someone, you've gotta 
          trust them. There's no other way. 
          You've got to give them the key to 
          everything that's yours.  Otherwise, 
          what's the point? And, for a while... 
          I believed that's the kind of love I 
          had.

Suddenly, the car explodes. Flames, smoke and metal rise 
into the sky covering the view of the Las Vegas casinos and 
their signs.

Music in: J.S. Bach - 'St Matthew Passion'.

Ace's body comes flying in - extreme slow motion. His body 
twists and turns through the frame like a soul about to tumble 
into the flames of damnation.

MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

Vignette of ACE through rippling flames, we move in on ACE 
ROTHSTEIN overseeing the casino. He lights a cigarette.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Before I ever ran a casino or got 
          myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a 
          hell of a handicapper, I can tell 
          you that. I was so good, that whenever 
          I bet, I could change the odds for 
          every bookmaker in the country. I'm 
          serious. I had it down so cold that 
          I was given paradise on earth. I was 
          given one of the biggest casinos in 
          Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers...

INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - 
NIGHT

Vignette of MOB BOSSES sitting at a table surrounded by food 
and wine like the gods of Olympus.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...by the only kind of guys that can 
          actually get you that kind of money: 
          sixty-two million, seven-hundred 
          thousand dollars. I don't know all 
          the details.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Matter of fact...

INT. BAR, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

Vignette of NICKY SANTORO standing at a bar with DOMINICK 
SANTORO, his brother, and FRANK MARINO, his right-hand man.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...nobody knew all the details, but 
          it should'a been perfect. I mean, he 
          had me, Nicky Santoro, his best 
          friend, watching his ass...

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Vignette of GINGER MCKENNA a dazzling thirty-one-year-old 
blonde seated by a small fiery pool.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...and he had Ginger, the woman he 
          loved, on his arm.  But in the end...

INT. TANGIERS SPORTSBOOK/ACE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

ACE looks over the casino he rules.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...we fucked it all up. It should'a 
          been so sweet, too.  But it turned 
          out to be the last time that street 
          guys like us were ever given anything 
          that fuckin' valuable again.

EXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

Aerial shot coming down out of the clouds over the brightly 
lit Vegas Strip and off into the blackness of the desert 
night.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          At that time, Vegas was a place where 
          millions of suckers flew in every 
          year on their own nickel, and left 
          behind about a billion dollars. But 
          at night, you couldn't see the desert 
          that surrounds Las Vegas...

EXT. DESERT - DAWN

Aerial shot swooping along the desert floor, then rising 
above the mist to reveal mountains in the distance.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But it's in the desert where lots of 
          the town's problems are solved.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Got a lot of holes in the desert, 
          and a lot of problems are buried in 
          those holes. Except you gotta do it 
          right. I mean, you gotta have the 
          hole already dug before you show up 
          with a package in the trunk.  
          Otherwise you're talkin' about a 
          half-hour or forty-five minutes of 
          diggin'. And who knows who's gonna 
          be comin' along in that time? Before 
          you know it, you gotta dig a few 
          more holes. You could be there all 
          fuckin' night.

EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP, 1973 - NIGHT

TITLE IN: 'THE STRIP', 'LAS VEGAS', 'TEN YEARS EARLIER'

ACE is greeted by a casino exec and walked through the 
brightly lit entrance to the Tangiers Casino.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Who could resist? Anywhere else in 
          the country, I was a bookie, a 
          gambler, always lookin' over my 
          shoulder, hassled by cops, day and 
          night. But here, I'm 'Mr Sam 
          Rothstein'. I'm not only legitimate, 
          but running a casino. And that's 
          like selling dreams for cash.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

We see ACE enter alone. He is greeted by BILLY SHERBERT. 
They are joined by top executives RICHIE and RONNIE in suits 
and ties. They walk through the casino, past crowded and 
noisy craps tables, spinning roulette wheels, blackjack 
tables, poker-faced players at poker tables, and elegant, 
cordoned-off, black-tie, baccarat tables.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I hired an old casino pal, Billy 
          Sherbert, as my manager and I went 
          to work.

                      SHERBERT
               (Introducing the EXECS 
               to ACE)
          ...And this is Ronnie, who takes 
          care of the card room...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          For guys like me, Las Vegas washes 
          away your sins. It's a morality car 
          wash. It does for us what Lourdes 
          does for humpbacks and cripples. 
          And, along with making us legit...

INT. TANGIERS/HARD COUNT ROOM - NIGHT

Dolly back from a wall of money. An employee pours a bucket 
full of coins into a trough. Camera follows progress as 
numerous coins move on a conveyor system, through a sorting 
machine. Camera reveals several rolls of coins on a lower 
conveyor as they move up a ladder towards an employee's hands, 
who then places the rolls on a rack.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...comes cash. Tons of it. I mean, 
          what do you think we're doing out 
          here in the middle of the desert?  
          It's all this money. This is the end 
          result of all the bright lights and 
          the comped trips, of all the champagne 
          and free hotel suites, and all the 
          broads and all the booze. It's all 
          been arranged just for us to get 
          your money. That's the truth about 
          Las Vegas.

INT. TANGIERS/FLOOR/SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY

Camera follows JOHN NANCE carrying a small suitcase and 
walking through the casino to a door leading to the cashier's 
cage. The sign on the door reads 'Authorized Personnel Only'. 
He walks through the cage, to another door: 'Notice - Keep 
Out'.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          We're the only winners. The players 
          don't stand a chance. And their cash 
          flows from the tables to our boxes 
          ...through the cage and into the 
          most sacred room in the casino ...the 
          place where they add up all the money 
          ...the holy of holies ...the count 
          room.

He opens the door. We see inside the count room from NANCE'S 
point of view.

It looks like the area behind a teller's cage in a bank. A 
large room, windowless, decor-free. One side is a mesh cage, 
opened to reveal stacks of cash boxes. Several COUNTERS in 
white shirts are gathered around a glass table counting and 
sorting paper money.)

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Now this place was off limits.

                      COUNTER #1
          Verify two thousand.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Even I couldn't get inside, but it 
          was my job to keep it filled with 
          cash. That's for sure.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          They had so much fuckin' money in 
          there, you could build a house out 
          of stacks of $100 bills. And the 
          best part was that upstairs, the 
          board of directors didn't know what 
          the fuck was going on.

At one end of the room the clerks empty the metal boxes and 
rapidly count the cash at a counting table. The camera follows 
a cash 'drop box' being lifted from the stack by a clerk. He 
pours the cash on to the table and shows the empty box to a 
video camera. COUNTER #2 rapidly counts the cash and 
announces:

                      COUNTER #2
          Five thousand.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I mean, to them everything looked on 
          the up and up. Right? Wrong.

The first counter recounts the cash.

                      COUNTER #1
          Verify five thousand.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          The guys inside the counting room...

Stacks of bills lie nearby. The camera pans across the room 
to another table manned by a COUNT ROOM EXECUTIVE who repeats 
the figure and writes it down on a master list.

                      COUNT ROOM EXEC
          Five thousand.

We move back to NANCE opening a cabinet full of stacks of 
$100 bills. He opens his suitcase and begins to fill it with 
cash. As he does this, the workers studiously look in other 
directions.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...were all slipped in there to skim 
          the joint dry.  They'd do short 
          counts, they'd lose fill slips. They'd 
          even take cash right out of the drop 
          boxes. And it was up to this guy 
          right here [NANCE], standin' in front 
          of about two million dollars, to 
          skim the cash off the top without 
          anybody gettin' wise ...the IRS or 
          anybody.

                      COUNTER #1
          Verify two hundred.

NANCE closes the case and walks out. One of the counters 
dumps another container of money on the table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now, notice how in the count room 
          nobody ever seems to see anything. 
          Somehow, somebody's always lookin' 
          the other way. Now, look at these 
          guys [COUNTERS]. They look busy, 
          right?  They're countin' money. Who 
          wants to bother them? I mean, God 
          forbid they should make a mistake 
          and forget to steal. Meanwhile, you're 
          in and you're out.

NANCE exits the count room and proceeds through the lobby of 
the casino, passing ACE and SHERBERT, to a side exit door.

                      NICKY
          Past the jag-off guard who gets an 
          extra c-note a week just to watch 
          the door.  I mean, it's routine. 
          Business as usual: in, out, hello, 
          goodbye. And that's all there is to 
          it. Just another fat fuck walkin' 
          out of the casino with a suitcase. 
          Now, that suitcase was goin' straight 
          to one place: right to Kansas City 
          ...which was as close to Las Vegas 
          as the Midwest bosses could go without 
          gettin' themselves arrested.

NANCE leaves the casino and gets into a cab parked at the 
curb.

EXT. KANSAS CITY AIRPORT - DAY

NANCE arrives. He is greeted by ARTIE PISCANO, a gray-haired 
sixty-year-old underboss.

TITLE IN: 'KANSAS CITY'

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          That suitcase was all the bosses 
          ever wanted ...and they wanted it 
          every month.

                      PISCANO
          Hey, John, how are you? How was your 
          ride?

EXT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY

NANCE, with suitcase, and PISCANO leave the car and enter 
the produce market.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now this old Mormon fuck here...

              CUT TO: NANCE, AS HE GETS OUT OF PISCANO'S CAR

INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY

NANCE and PISCANO walk through the grocery store, through 
the warehouse, past various employees to a doorway leading 
into the back room, where they are greeted by five older men 
around a large wooden table with bowls of macaroni and old 
jelly glasses filled with red wine.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...he had to fly in with suitcases 
          once a month, nice and easy.

                      NANCE
          Somethin' smells good.

                      PISCANO
          Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          The bosses would come from all over 
          the place: Detroit, Cleveland, 
          Milwaukee. All over the Midwest.  
          And they would meet in the back of 
          this produce market in Kansas City. 
          I mean, nobody even knew.

NANCE shakes hands with AMERICO CAPELLI, sixty-eight, a bald, 
affable Milwaukee entrepreneur and ARTHUR CAPP, his thirty-
year-old yuppie lawyer son.

Camera continues to pan around the room.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          One of the guys made his mother do 
          all the cooking.

On VINCENT BORELLI, seventy-year-old Kansas City boss.

                      BORELLI
          Did you ever see that guy Jerry 
          Steriano?

On VINNIE FORLANO, mid-seventies, an old-timer who once drove 
for Capone and is now Remo Gaggi's right-hand man.

                      FORLANO
          Jerry Steriano?

                      BORELLI
          Yeah.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now, these old greaseballs might not 
          look it, but believe me, these are 
          the guys who secretly controlled Las 
          Vegas.

PISCANO joins his MOTHER and DAUGHTER by a stove.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          That man's here again.

Piscano dips a piece of bread into a pot of tomato sauce.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Because they controlled the Teamsters' 
          Union, and that's where you had to 
          go if you wanted to borrow money to 
          buy a casino.

                      BORELLI (O.S.)
          When you've finished with him, I 
          want him.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
               (Carrying a plate of 
               food to the table 
               where BORELLI and 
               FORLANO are seated.)
          Here you are, gentlemen.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          And nobody got a Teamsters' loan, 
          unless the guys in this room knew 
          they were gonna get their little 
          suitcases.

FORLANO gets up from the table and walks toward NANCE.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Guys like this antique here [FORLANO], 
          out of Detroit. Or especially guys 
          like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top 
          boss.

NANCE embraces REMO GAGGI who's seated on a couch, and sits 
across from him.

                      GAGGI
          You got a round figure on it?

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Definitely the most important guy in 
          this room.

                      NANCE
               (Picking up the 
               suitcase)
          About twenty pounds.

                      GAGGI
          So?

                      NANCE
          That's around seven hundred thousand.

                      GAGGI
          Uh-huh, good.

NANCE opens the case to reveal the money.

               (Off-screen, from 
               following scene)
          I know it's a little early for Las 
          Vegas...

INT. TANGIERS EXECUTIVE OFFICE PRESS CONFERENCE/BANQUET ROOM - 
DAY

Camera tilts down a model of the Tangiers Hotel and Casino, 
then reveals the cover of Business Week magazine with a 
drawing of PHILIP GREEN, a young corporate type, smiling out 
under the headline: 'Philip Green, Vegas Wunderkind'.

                      STONE (O.S.)
          ...but I do want to welcome the ladies 
          and gentlemen of the gaming industry.

On ANDY STONE, a middle-aged man at a podium giving a speech 
while GREEN, seated at a table, looks on. PHOTOGRAPHERS flash 
their cameras. ACE and SHERBERT, sitting next to GREEN, also 
watch the photo op ceremony.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          As far as the world was concerned 
          Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' 
          Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.

                      STONE
          This is a very auspicious occasion.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          A powerful man.

                      STONE
          Philip, if you would rise.

Green stands up.   

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He even played golf with the 
          President.

                      STONE
          On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension 
          Fund, it is my pleasure to present 
          to you . . .

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But Andy also took orders. And when 
          he was told to give a pension fund 
          loan to Philip Green...

                      STONE
               (Handing GREEN a large 
               cardboard facsimile 
               'check')
          ...this check for $62,700,000 for 
          the new Tangiers.

                      GREEN
          Thank you.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...he did what he was told.

PHILIP GREEN, who is now the head of the Tangiers Hotel and 
Casino Corporation, is standing at the podium giving a speech.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now here was the perfect front man. 
          I mean, what the fuck else could he 
          be?  He didn't know too much. He 
          didn't want to know too much, 
          especially that the bosses made the 
          Teamsters lend him the money. He 
          wanted to believe the Teamsters gave 
          him all that fuckin' money 'cause he 
          was smart.

An exploding flash bulb fills the screen.

                      GREEN
          ...I say that, knowing full well 
          just how much competition we have in 
          this great city.

EXT. CHEAP MOTEL OFF HIGHWAY - DAY

We see a MAN and a WOMAN swimming underwater. Camera reveals 
that they are in a motel swimming pool with glass portholes.  
Expensive cars are parked outside one of the rooms. Hoods 
stand around outside the door.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          And where they got Green from - who 
          the fuck knows?  All I know is that 
          Green was an Arizona real estate 
          hustler, who barely had enough gas 
          money to come and pick up his own 
          fuckin' check...

INT. TANGIERS EXECUTIVE OFFICE PRESS CONFERENCE/BANQUET ROOM - 
DAY

We return to the press conference. Photographers snap away. 
In the background are six-foot blow-ups of the Business Week 
cover. The camera moves past GREEN, CAPP and several other 
men, past SHERBERT, to ACE.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now, all they needed was somebody 
          they could trust to run the casino. 
          And who better than Ace?  I mean, he 
          was already in Vegas a couple of 
          years and he had the fuckin' place 
          clocked.

FREEZE FRAME ON ACE.

INT. TANGIERS SWIMMING POOL - DAY

Camera looks straight down from the top of a hotel to a large 
pool area.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But typical Ace...

INT. TANGIERS SWIMMING POOL/POOLSIDE - DAY

STONE, in a bathing suit and robe, sits on a lounge chair 
with a telephone. ACE, in sports clothes, sits on another 
chair.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...give him a shot at runnin' a casino 
          and he tries to talk you out of it.

                      ACE
          You know, I don't know if I could do 
          this even if I wanted to. The Gaming 
          Commission would never give me a 
          license. I have at least two dozen 
          gambling and bookmaking pinches on 
          me.

                      STONE
          You don't have to have a license to 
          work in a casino. All you gotta do 
          is apply for one. The state law says 
          you can work in a casino while they're 
          processing your application. They 
          got a ten-year backlog.

                      ACE
          But what happens when they do find 
          out?

                      STONE
          Why would they want to find out? 
          We're puttin' a hundred million into 
          this desert here. Why would they 
          want to lock us out?  And besides, 
          they'll never find out. All you gotta 
          do is keep changing your job title. 
          Like, uh, from Casino Executive to 
          Food and Beverage Chairman. And what 
          happens it, they take your 
          application, they put it at the bottom 
          of the pile. I know guys workin' 
          there for thirty years, don't have a 
          license.

                      ACE
               (Exhales)
          It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, 
          you know, if I did it, I'd have to 
          run it my way.

                      STONE
          You got it.

                      ACE
          I'm serious. No interference.

                      STONE
          Nobody's gonna interfere with your 
          running the casino. I guarantee it.

Stone lights a cigarette.

INT. TANGIERS CRAPS PIT - NIGHT

ACE blows on a die.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          And that's how that got Ace to take 
          over.

ACES's hands place the die into a micrometer.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
           
          They wanted him because Ace ate, 
          slept and breathed gambling.

Camera swish tilts up to ACE, then swish pans to boxman, 
dealers and players watching him, trying to act calm.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          They worked out a real cute job title 
          too.

We see the die in the micrometer.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Tangiers Public Relations Director.

Satisfied the die is not loaded ACE sets it on the craps 
table, the camera cranes up to reveal the Tangiers Casino 
floor.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But the only thing he ever directed 
          was the casino. He made his first 
          bet when he was fifteen years old, 
          and he always made money. But he 
          didn't bet like you or me.

A DEALER is sliding chips, tossing them on to a craps table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          You know, havin' some fun with it, 
          shit like that.

                      ACE
               (Approaching the DEALER)
          Where the hell did you learn how to 
          deal?
               (He reaches down, 
               stacking and arranging 
               the chips.)

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.

                      ACE
               (To the chastised 
               DEALER)
          Place the checks properly. That's 
          the way you do it.

                      DEALER
          Yes, sir.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He had to know everything, this guy.

Direct overhead tracking shot as ACE walks between two rows 
of gaming tables.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He'd find out the kind of inside 
          stuff nobody else knew, and that's 
          what he'd put his money on.

INT. GYM/BOOKIE JOINT, BACK HOME, PRE-SEVENTIES - DAY

ACE walks past two boxers sparring in a ring, through a 
doorway into a room where several gamblers are seated around 
a table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Even back home, years ago, when we 
          were first hangin' out together...

TITLE IN: 'BACK HOME, YEARS AGO'

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...he'd know if the quarterback was 
          on coke.

ACE is looking at the odds board for college football games. 
The bookie, LUCKY LARRY, is waiting for ACE to hand in his 
picks.

                      ACE
          I'll take Columbia for twenty.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          If his girlfriend was knocked up.

                      LUCKY LARRY
          Twenty dimes on Columbia . . .

As soon as ACE bets, a man erases a number from the chalkboard 
and replaces it was a '6', changing the odds. Two GAMBLERS 
saunter from the room.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He'd get the wind velocity so he 
          could judge the field goals. He even 
          figured out the different bounce you 
          got off the different kinds of wood 
          they used on college basketball 
          courts, you know?

EXT. GYM/BOOKIE JOINT PUBLIC PHONES - DAY

The two GAMBLERS we saw sauntering out of the bookie joint 
are racing to the nearest public phones. Another GAMBLER has 
already beaten them to it.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He'd be workin' on this shit day and 
          night. There was nothin' about a 
          game he was gonna bet that he didn't 
          know.

                      GAMBLER #1
               (Into phone)
          Ace got down at six.

                      GAMBLER #2
               (Into phone)
          Charlie, hey. Rothstein got six.

INT. GYM/BOOKIE JOINT, SEVERAL DAYS LATER - DAY

A bookie hands a stack of money to another bookie, who hands 
the money to ACE.

ACE removes several bills from the top of the stack of 
winnings and holds them out to the BOOKIES.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Season after season, the prick was 
          the only guaranteed winner I ever 
          knew. But he was so serious about it 
          all that I don't think he ever enjoyed 
          himself.  But...

ACE exits.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...that's just the way he was.

INT. MOB SOCIAL CLUB BACK ROOM - NIGHT

The room has an espresso machine and a saint's day calendar. 
Assorted hoods are listening to NICKY at the bar. Camera 
dollies to REMO GAGGI, at the rear table playing gin rummy 
with OLD MAN CAPO and losing. Every time the CAPO picks up a 
card, he's able to knock or get gin, sending GAGGI into a 
fit bemoaning his bad luck.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But back then the bosses didn't give 
          a fuck about whether he enjoyed 
          himself of not. To them, he was a 
          cash register. All they had to do 
          was ring the bell and take the money. 
          Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' 
          degenerate gambler who always lost.

                      GAGGI
               (Slams down his cards 
               and curses at his 
               losing hands)
          Ma che cazzo!

[Italian-American slang for 'What a prick.'] All those fuckin' 
sweeps.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I mean, unless Ace made his bet.

                      GAGGI
          That's enough now!

                      OLD MAN CAPO
          I can't contest the cards.

                      GAGGI
          Va fa 'n culo! [Italian-American 
          slang for 'Fuck off'] 
               (Summoning a young 
               man.)
          Johnny!

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Ace made more money for them on a 
          weekend than I could do heisting 
          joints for a month.

ACE enters and walks to GAGGI's table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Whatever Ace picked up on the street 
          he told Remo.

                      NICKY
               (Walks over to ACE 
               and whispers)
          Hey, did you bring that thing?

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          You know, I mean fixed fights, doped 
          horses, crooked fuckin' zebras... 
          locked-in point spreads. He told 
          fuckin' Remo everything. And to tell 
          you the truth. I don't blame him.

GAGGI stands up and shakes ACE's hand.

                      GAGGI
          Ace.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Keepin' Remo happy with money was 
          the greatest insurance policy in the 
          world.

GAGGI beams as ACE takes out an envelope filled with cash 
and hands it over to him. GAGGI sits back down and ACE, 
knowing his place, smiles and is about to leave.

                      GAGGI
          Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you 
          get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever 
          had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd 
          you do it?

                      ACE
          Well, that's why they paid so well.

                      GAGGI
          You see?
               (Chuckles.)
          Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do 
          we got on for next week?

                      ACE
          Well, it's a little too early. I'd 
          say Thursday would be good. I'll 
          know by then. Is that all right?

                      GAGGI
          Okay. You come by the house?

                      ACE
          I'll come by.

                      GAGGI
          Seven o'clock?

                      ACE
          Seven o'clock.

GAGGI gets up and kisses ACE as NICKY and OLD MAN CAPO look 
on.

                      GAGGI
          Good job, my boy. Keep it up. Okay, 
          Ace?

ACE nods in agreement and leaves the room.

                      GAGGI
               (To NICKY)
          Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian-
          American slang for 'Come here']

                      NICKY
               (To ACE)
          I'll be right out.

                      GAGGI
          T'aggia parla. [Italian-American 
          slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] 
          Nicky... See that guy?
               (pointing to the off-
               screen ACE)

                      NICKY
          Mm.

                      GAGGI
          Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' 
          a lot of money for us. And he's gonna 
          continue makin' a lot of money for 
          us, so keep a good eye on him.

                      NICKY
          Mm.

                      GAGGI
          Not like your fuckin' friends out 
          there, that... without brains.  Okay?

                      NICKY
          All right.

                      GAGGI
          Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian-
          American slang for 'I'm counting on 
          you']

                      NICKY
          Yeah.

                      GAGGI
          Fine.

                      NICKY
               (Reaching down to 
               touch GAGGI's money, 
               joking with him.)
          Want me to take this for you?
               (He walks out.)

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          So, now, on top of everything else, 
          I gotta make sure that nobody fucks 
          around with the Golden Jew.

INT. BACK HOME BAR - NIGHT

We move past JOE, a guy at the bar entertaining a BRUNETTE 
and a BLONDE, to NICKY and FRANK MARINO at the other end. 
There are other bar patrons in the background.

                      JOE
               (To the BARTENDER)
          Chase, couple of shooters for the 
          ladies.

                      BARTENDER (O.S.)
          All right.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Yeah, we made a great pair. I made 
          book and Nicky made sure we always 
          collected. The old men loved us. And 
          why not? They all made money with 
          us.

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO)
          They payin'?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          How did Nicky collect?

                      MARINO
          They pay every week, like they're 
          supposed to.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Don't ask. 

                      NICKY
          Then where the fuck is the money? I 
          don't see the money.

ACE enters, and greets the two girls.

                      ACE
          Hi, Melissa. Heidi.

                      BLONDE
          Hi, Sam.

                      JOE
               (To the GIRLS)
          Who's this guy?

                      MARINO
               (To NICKY)
          Get the fuck out of here. It was 
          nine. I laid nine.

ACE approaches NICKY and MARINO.

                      NICKY
          It was eight.  Ace... tell him the 
          line on the Bear's game.

                      ACE
          Eight.

                      NICKY
          If he don't know, nobody knows. Told 
          you it was eight.

                      MARINO
          Well, how come I laid nine?

                      NICKY
          'Cause you're a jag-off. I would 
          have fuckin' made you lay ten...

ACE notices a pen lying on the bar. He taps JOE on the 
shoulder.

                      ACE
               (To JOE)
          Excuse me.

                      JOE
          What?

                      ACE
               (He holds up the pen)
          Is this yours? Your pen?

                      JOE
          Yeah, that's my pen. Why?

                      ACE
          I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just 
          didn't know whose it was. I thought 
          it was yours. I didn't want it to 
          get lost.

                      JOE
          Well, thank you. Why don't you take 
          that fuckin' pen and shove it up you 
          ass, you fuckin' jag-off?

NICKY looks over.

                      ACE
          Well, I was just offering you the-

NICKY moves towards JOE.

                      JOE
               (Turning his back to 
               talk to the girls, 
               referring to ACE)
          This fuckin' asshole.

NICKY grabs the pen out of ACE's hand.

                      MAN #1
               (To JOE)
          Look out!

Before ACE can react, NICKY grabs JOE and starts stabbing 
him in the neck with the pen.

                      MAN #1
          Joe! Look out, Joe! Look out!

NICKY grunts while JOE gasps and groans. The BLONDE screams 
while NICKY's hand continues to plunge the pen into JOE's 
throat. JOE tumbles to the floor.

NICKY pounces on him, still stabbing and now kicking. JOE 
whimpers.

                      NICKY
          What's that? You hear? You hear a 
          little girl, Frankie? You hear a 
          little girl, Ace? Is that a little 
          fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the 
          fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend 
          stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! 
          Huh?!

                      ACE
               (Over whimpers and 
               pants)
          Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta-
          take it easy.

ACE looks stunned. NICKY's still holding the bloody pen.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          While I was tryin' to figure out why 
          the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', 
          Nicky just hit him. No matter how 
          big a guy might be, Nicky would take 
          him on. You beat Nicky with fists, 
          he comes back with a bat. You beat 
          him with a knife, he comes back with 
          a gun. And you beat him with a gun, 
          you better kill him, because he'll 
          keep comin' back and back until one 
          of you is dead.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Listen...

INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR, 1972 - NIGHT

Camera swoops from a woman cheering as she wins at a slot-
machine to a blackjack table, then to a roulette table and 
over to a craps table.

Montage of very short cuts of chips being picked up, dice 
thrown, money being poured from a bucket, stacks of money.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...with me protecting Ace, he made a 
          fortune for the bosses. I mean that's 
          what got him to Vegas. He was a money 
          machine. A tremendous earner for 
          these guys.  As soon as he took over, 
          he doubled the fuckin' drop. With 
          Ace the casino never saw so much 
          money. And the bosses, they couldn't 
          be happier.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

Camera moves in on ACE as he looks out over the casino. 
Dealers deftly stack chips, scoop up losses and pay off 
winners. Chips and money are everywhere.

In extreme close-up slow motion a die falls on to a table.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO SLOT-MACHINE AREA - NIGHT

ACE and SHERBERT are walking down a casino aisle by the slot-
machines. Dealers immediately snap to attention at their 
approach.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced-
          in local cowboys working. They were 
          close to the, you know, good old 
          boys.

                      ACE
               (To SHERBERT)
          Pay him six hundred a week, tell him 
          to walk around and look smart.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, without us, these guys, they'd 
          still be shovellin' mule shit.

ACE points at paper cups, empty glasses and the debris of 
silver dollar wrappings on the floor. DON WARD, the Slots 
Manager in Western garb, immediately starts picking up the 
debris. ACE looks at WARD sternly.

                      ACE
          Ward, you gotta keep a cleaner 
          station. If you need 'Mr Clean', 
          page him, all right?

WARD bends down and picks up some trash.

                      WARD
          It won't happen again, Sam.

                      ACE
          Mr Rothstein.

                      ACE
               (To SHERBERT)
          Is this guy just another dumb fuckin' 
          white man, or what? What's his story?

                      SHERBERT
          We need this guy.

                      ACE
          We can't get rid of him?

                      SHERBERT
          He's juiced in. He's the County 
          Commissioner's cousin.

                      ACE
          I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.

They exit.

INT. TANGIERS BACCARAT TABLES - NIGHT

A card shoe slides across the baccarat table. A state SENATOR, 
a little drunk, tips the dealer, kisses the blonder HOOKER 
with him, fills his pockets with his winnings and walks over 
to see ACE.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          These yokels ran the state.

                      DEALER #1
          Thank you very much, Senator.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They passed the laws, they owned the 
          courts.

                      SENATOR
          Hi, Ace.

                      ACE
          Hello, Senator.

They shake hands.

                      SENATOR
               (To ACE)
          Hey, I need a room. Need a room.

                      ACE
          Good to see ya.
               (To SHERBERT)
          William would you...

The SENATOR shakes hands with SHERBERT as the HOOKER joins 
them.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I had dozens of politicians and state 
          officials comin' through that place 
          every week.

                      SHERBERT
          Nice to see you, Senator.

                      ACE
               (To SHERBERT)
          Help the Senator, give him whatever 
          he wants.

                      SHERBERT
          Certainly.
               (Leads the way.)
          Senator.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Why not make them happy?

                      SHERBERT
          We have some nice penthouses you'll 
          enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.

INT. TANGIERS PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY

The SENATOR unzips the HOOKER's dress, kisses her and walks 
through the bedroom doorway, looking over his shoulder to 
her as she takes off her dress and walks out of his sight.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          For politicians...

INT. TANGIERS BACCARAT TABLES - DAY

ACE smoking a cigarette by the baccarat tables.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...like our state senator up there, 
          everything was on the house.

INT. TANGIERS PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY

The SENATOR opens a bureau drawer and takes out a small velvet 
pouch and pours black $100 into his palm.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          These guys won their comped life 
          when they got elected. So, hey, why 
          not take advantage of it? Still, the 
          politicians come cheap. We could 
          handle them.

INT. TANGIERS, ICHIKAWA LUXURY SUITE - DAY

K. K. ICHIKAWA a Japanese businessman, and a male associate 
pick up towels and soap from about the bedroom of their suite. 
A blonde woman checks herself in the mirror.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          It's a whale like K. K. Ichikawa, 
          who plays thirty thousand dollars a 
          hand in baccarat. That's the one you 
          really gotta watch.

ICHIKAWA and his associate walk into the the suite's living-
room and join a Japanese woman seated on a couch.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He plays fast and big and he has the 
          cash and the credit to turn out your 
          lights. About a year ago, he cleaned 
          out a couple of casinos in the Cayman 
          Islands.

They begin to stuff Tangiers soap and towels into their 
luggage.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Downstairs, he takes us for two 
          million... and upstairs he takes 
          free soap, shampoo and towels. Another 
          billionaire cheapskate who loves his 
          free rooms...

EXT. TANGIERS JET, LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY

The Tangiers jet with the Tangiers logo on its side as 
ICHIKAWA shakes ACE's hands before boarding. SHERBERT follows 
him and his associates aboard.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...free private jets, and two million 
          of our money.

                      ACE
          Nice to see you again.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But we got him back. I had our pilot 
          tell him the plane was on the fritz.

EXT. TANGIERS JET, STILL IN THE SAME SPOT - NIGHT

SHERBERT apologizes to ICHIKAWA and his entourage as they 
all get off the jet.

                      SHERBERT
          Ken, I don't know what the hell went 
          wrong. I'm awfully sorry.

                      ICHIKAWA
          This is a big problem. Big problem.

                      SHERBERT
          I can't understand it. These 
          mechanical things, you know, they 
          happen. Hey, be-better here than
               (gesturing to the sky)
          up there, you know what I mean?

INT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT RESERVATION DESK - NIGHT

SHERBERT arguing with TICKET AGENT as ICHIKAWA and entourage 
look glum.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Then he missed the commercial flights 
          connecting with Japan.

                      AGENT
          I'm so sorry. There's a convention 
          in town, and all flights are booked.

                      SHERBERT
          A convention?
               (Turning to ICHIKAWA)
          I can't believe that there's a 
          convention. It's never... ?

                      ICHIKAWA
          What can I do?

EXT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

A smiling ACE greets ICHIKAWA and his entourage as they drive 
up and get out of Tangiers limos.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          We got him back ...with a whole floor 
          of rooms for himself.

                      ACE
          I'm sorry you missed the plane.

                      ICHIKAWA
          You want to get my money back, right?
               (Chuckles)

                      ACE
          No, no, no. No gambling. No.

INT. TANGIERS BACCARAT TABLES - NIGHT

ICHIKAWA, with the Japanese woman, picks up some chips and 
places them on the table. ACE and SHERBERT watch from behind 
a barrier.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He bet one thousand a hand instead 
          of his usual thirty thousand a hand.

A dealer's hands slide two cards on the table.

                      DEALER
          The bank wins a natural eight over a 
          five.

Another dealer's hands place two chips on a table. ICHIKAWA 
looks on.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But I knew, the trick with whales 
          like Ichikawa was that they can't 
          bet small for long. He didn't think 
          of it as winning ten thousand, he 
          thought of it as losing ninety 
          thousand.

ICHIKAWA places a larger bet.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          So, he upped his bets...

A dealer picks up some chips from a rack and places them on 
the table.

ICHIKAWA is now seated with stacks of chips in front of him.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...until he dropped his winnings 
          back and gave up a million of his 
          own cash.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

ICHIKAWA, hours later, his chips depleted. ACE and SHERBERT 
still watch from behind the barrier as millions in chips are 
back in the dealer's racks.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          In the casino, the cardinal rule is 
          to keep them playing...

Move in on ACE as he smokes a cigarette.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...and keep them coming back. The 
          longer they play, the more they lose. 
          In the end, we get it all.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

ACE, with pit bosses next to him, looks out over the huge 
casino where hundreds of thousands of dollars are being poured 
into machines.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch 
          everybody else.

                      DEALER
          Six, an easy way. Six! All right, 
          who's gonna give me... 

The DEALER places some chips on the table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Since the players are looking to 
          beat the casino...

THE CAMERA IS ON THE DEALER.

                      DEALER
          ...both dice must hit that back wall 
          each and every roll. All right, make 
          a six!

                      DEALER
          Come on, baby, make a six!

A BOX MAN, seated mid-table is watching the DEALER.

          us all.

SWISH PAN TO:

INT. TANGIERS-EYE-IN-THE SKY MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT

Video monitors show a dealer fanning a row of bills. Swish

INT. TANGIERS CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT

Ginger squeals as she throws the dice across the table.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Come on, come on.

She rolls a winner.

                      GINGER
          Yes!

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Thank you. Very nice.

                      GINGER
               (Chuckles)
          I told you I was hot tonight.

INT. TANGIERS EYE-IN-THE-SKY MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT

Sound out: The monitor shows GINGER and the HIGH ROLLER 
cheering, she throws her arms around him. The crowd goes 
crazy.

SWISH PAN TO ACE LOOKING ON INTENTLY.

On screen, GINGER's hand sneaks a chip from the rack and 
subtly moves it towards her purse.

INT. TANGIERS CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT

Sound in: GINGER slips the chip quietly into her bag.

                      HIGH ROLLER
               (Off-screen)
          Let's go. This is for Ginger. Come 
          on. This is for Ginger.

The HIGH ROLLER notices GINGER's hand on her purse. She 
pretends to have taken out her lipstick.

                      GAMBLER #1
          Let me have a hundred on the hard 
          ten. Thank you.

                      GAMBLER #2
          Hard ten. One hundred.

INT. TANGIERS EYE-IN-THE-SKY MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT

ACE continues to look at the monitor. SHERBERT and a security 
man seated at a video console also look on.

INT. TANGIERS CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT

A craps stick pushes some dice towards GINGER. She rolls 
again, only this time she craps out. Gamblers groan, then 
applaud her. She's made so much money for the table that the 
winners toss chips in her direction.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          I'm sorry.

                      GINGER
          Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
               (To the table)
          Thank you very much. Thank you very 
          much.

ACE and two casino execs are now on the floor watching her.

                      GINGER
          Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. 
          Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips 
          as tips to the dealer and box man. 
          Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances 
          and drive fast.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Ginger, honey.

                      DEALER
          Thank you very much, now.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Ginger, honey, this is for you love. 
          Thanks for your time.

She turns to the HIGH ROLLER, who is handing her a thin stack 
of chips worth about $2,000.

                      GINGER
               (Chuckles)
          Come on.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          What's the matter?

                      GINGER
          What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' 
          I made a lot of money for you. I 
          want my cut.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          What money? I've seen you stealing 
          from me.

                      GINGER
          What money?  Look at this stack of 
          chips. Don't give me that shit. I 
          want my end.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Ginger, I've been watching you all 
          night. You've been stealing from me.

                      GINGER
          Don't give me that shit. I want my 
          money.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          That bag's full of fuckin' chips you

                      GINGER
               (Interrupts)
          What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't 
          steal anything from you.

ACE watches the argument heat up.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!

                      GINGER
          Get lost?

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Yes.

                      GINGER
          Get lost?

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Yes.

GINGER knocks the chip rack out of his hands.

                      GINGER
          Well, how 'bout that?

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Come on!
               (He bends down to 
               pick them up.)

Gamblers and dealers shout and yell. She picks up another 
rack of chips and tosses them into the air, then another, 
and another. Chips fly all over the casino. Everyone starts 
diving for chips. Dealers. Players. Security guards.  
Waitresses. Pit bosses. Bedlam.

ACE and the two execs with him are the only ones not diving 
for chips. He looks at GINGER. She looks at him.

FREEZE FRAME ON GINGER.

Slow motion: GINGER smiles at ACE and walks off.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          What a move. I fell in love right 
          there.

INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT

GINGER and ACE are seated on a banquette. Close up of his 
hand attaching a diamond and ruby pin to her dress. Tilt up 
to GINGER's smiling face beaming at ACE.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, 
          love costs money.

They kiss.

                      GINGER
          I'm going to go powder my nose.
               (ACE hands GINGER a 
               single $50 bill. She 
               smiles coyly. He 
               hands her another 
               fifty.)

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Ginger's mission in life was money.

                      GINGER
          I'll be right back.

                      ACE (O.S.)
               (from following scene)
          See you, Ginger.

FLASHBACK - EXT. CASINO ENTRANCE - NIGHT

GINGER waves goodbye to the DOORMAN and walks towards two 
VALET PARKERS who greet her warmly. She gets a bottle of 
pills from one of them and slips some cash into his hand in 
return.

                      GINGER
          Okay, thank you for asking.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She was a queen around the casino. 
          She brought in high rollers and helped 
          them spread around a lot of money.

                      GINGER
               (To VALET PARKERS)
          Hello.

                      VALET PARKER
          Hey, Ginger, how you doin'?

                      GINGER
          Great.
               (Handing the VALET 
               some money.)
          And I have something for you. You 
          got me covered?

The VALET PARKER places a vial of pills in her hand.

                      VALET PARKER
          Yes. Something for you, there.

                      GINGER
          And you do. Thank you very much.

                      VALET PARKER
          Take care of yourself.

FLASHBACK - INT. HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT

GINGER hands the pills to HIGH ROLLER #2 in his hotel 
bathroom, where he is washing his face and trying to energize 
himself.

                      GINGER
          I got some lucky pills for you, honey.

                      HIGH ROLLER #2
          Oh, yeah?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Who didn't want Ginger? She was one 
          of the best-known, best-liked and 
          most respected hustlers in town.  
          Smart hustlers like her could keep a 
          guy awake for two or three days before 
          sending him home broke to the little 
          woman and his bank examiners.

INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT

GINGER comes back from the ladies room. She kisses ACE.

                      ACE
          Any change?

                      GINGER
               (Chuckles)
          I hit a few... uh, games on the way 
          back.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          That was all bullshit. She just 
          pocketed the cash.

FLASHBACK - INT. TANGIERS CASHIER'S CAGE - NIGHT

GINGER converts her chips into a pile of $100 bills.

                      GINGER
               (To CASHIER)
          How you doin' tonight?

                      CASHIER
          Good. How are you?

                      GINGER
               (Sighing)
          Oh, beat.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Ginger had the hustler's code.

                      CASHIER
          Okay.

                      GINGER
          Take one for you.

                      CASHIER
               (While she counts out 
               the cash)
          Thank you.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She knew how to take care of people. 
          And that's what Vegas was all about.

                      CASHIER
               (As she pushes a stack 
               of $100 bills across 
               the counter)
          Sixty-eight hundred.

                      GINGER
          Thanks

She picks up the cash.

                      CASHIER
          You're welcome.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          It's Kickback City.

                      GINGER
          You have a good night.

                      CASHIER
          Thank you. You too.

palm. She slips the folded bill deftly into the palm of a 
floor manager.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She took care of the dealers...

                      GINGER
          Hey, Mitch.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...pit bosses, floor managers.

                      GINGER
          Thank you.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But mostly...

EXT. TANGIERS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

GINGER, on her way out of the casino, passes a folded $100 
bill to a smiling older SHIFT BOSS.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...she took care of the valet parkers, 
          the guys who could get you anything 
          and take care of anything.

                      GINGER
          Thanks a lot.

                      SHIFT BOSS
          Thank you, Ginger.

EXT. TANGIERS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

GINGER exits and gets into her car, slipping a VALET PARKER 
a $100 bill.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Ginger took care of the parkers 
          because they took care of the security 
          guards, who took care of the metro 
          cops, who let her operate.

                      VALET PARKER #3
          Thank you, Ginger.

                      GINGER
               (Getting into her car)
          I need that stuff tonight.

                      VALET PARKER #3
          No problem.

                      GINGER
          You're a doll.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The valet parking job was such a 
          money-maker that they had to pay off 
          the hotel manager just to get the 
          concession.

INT. GINGER'S APARTMENT - DAY

GINGER enters the room with $25,000 in her hands. She taps 
LESTER DIAMOND's leg with it and he turns to her.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But one thing I could never 
          understand, was that she could have 
          everything under control, except for 
          her old pimp boyfriend, Lester 
          Diamond.

                      LESTER
          Look, Gin, you know I got other people 
          in this. I got partners. But I want 
          you to understand that I am lookin' 
          out for you in this thing.  Okay?  
          You're going to get yours back...   
          and you're gonna get it back first. 
          Okay?

                      GINGER
          All right.

                      LESTER
          Okay?

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      LESTER
          Where are you goin'? Where are you? 
          You're in that place. Where are you?

                      GINGER
          I'm here.

                      LESTER
          No, you're not. Where are you? Where 
          are you?

                      GINGER
          I'm always here for you.

                      LESTER
          You are.

                      GINGER
          I am.

He hastily kisses GINGER and slips out the door.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look 
          at this creep.

                      GINGER
          Good luck.

                      LESTER
          Yeah.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He was a moocher, a card cheat, a 
          country-club golf hustler. A 
          scumbag... chasing dentists for a 
          few bucks.

                      GINGER
          Careful.

GINGER looks out of the window and sees LESTER get into a 
convertible and drive off.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, the guy was always broke, he 
          always had a story. And somehow, she 
          could never turn him down. The way 
          Ginger saw it, I guess, was that 
          Lester was just an unlucky guy. 
          Somebody had to take care of him.

INT. BACK HOME AIRPORT/CUSTOMS - DAY

NICKY, his wife JENNIFER, with a beehive hairdo, and their 
eight-year-old son LITTLE NICKY, are detained while their 
luggage is searched by a customs agent.

TITLE IN: 'BACK HOME'

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But nobody had to take care of Nicky.

                      NICKY
               (To customs agent)
          You find any cash in there, we'll 
          whack it up with you.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, he took care of himself only 
          too well. And that's why every badge 
          back home wanted to nail him.

                      JENNIFER
               (To customs agent)
          Excuse me, but I folded these things 
          beautifully and I would appreciate a 
          little respect. Jesus Christ!

                      NICKY
          Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live 
          with her.

We see MARINO waiting for NICKY outside the customs area. 
Two COPS push past him.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Even after a little vacation, they 
          hassled him at the airport.

                      COP #1
               (To MARINO)
          Excuse me.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, Frank Marino was there to 
          meet him, but so were the cops. This 
          time they wanted to pinch him for 
          some diamond burglary in Antwerp.

CAMERA DOLLIES IN ON JENNIFER'S BEEHIVE.

                      JENNIFER
          Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, 
          please?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They were ready to blame him for 
          anything, no matter where it happened.

FLASH FORWARD - INT. NICKY'S HOUSE/BACK HOME - DAY

NICKY, JENNIFER, LITTLE NICKY and MARINO walk in.

                      JENNIFER
               (To LITTLE NICKY)
          You go and put your things away.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And they were usually right.

NICKY, JENNIFER and MARINO are gathered around the kitchen 
table. JENNIFER leans over and starts to shake her hair.

                      MARINO
          Whoa, whoa, whoa.

                      NICKY
          Hold it, hold it. Here.

NICKY places a red towel down on the table. JENNIFER leans 
over again, tugs and shakes her hair until diamonds begin to 
fall out of her beehive.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Because Nicky enjoyed being a 
          gangster, and he didn't give a damn 
          who knew it.

                      JENNIFER
          Come on. There we go. Look at that. 
          Beautiful.

Diamonds fall on the red towel in slow motion.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause 
          it turns out Nicky was about to be 
          sent to Vegas.

                      JENNIFER
          All right, we're clear.

                      NICKY
          There's more!

                      JENNIFER
          I think that's it.

                      NICKY
          There's more! There's a couple stuck 
          in there. I know there's more.

                      JENNIFER
          God, I'm telling you, they're out!

                      NICKY
          Come on, damn it. Don't get so 
          defensive. It could be stuck in your 
          hair, you know.

NICKY grasps JENNIFER's hair.

                      JENNIFER
          Look, there aren't...
               (A diamond falls out 
               of her beehive.)
          There aren't but...

                      NICKY
          Oh, there aren't?
               (Showing her the 
               diamond.)
          What's that?
               (Slaps her.)
          Huh? What's that.
               (FRANK chuckles.)
          There's no more. Thanks, hon.

INT. BACK HOME AIRPORT/CUSTOMS - DAY

ON NICKY.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I couldn't wait to get my hands on 
          Vegas. But the bosses didn't send me 
          out there to have a good time.

INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - 
NIGHT

Mob bosses FORLANO, CAPELLI, GAGGI, BORELLI and PISCANO seated 
around the back room table eating and talking as in the 
opening vignette.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          They sent me out there to make sure 
          that nobody fucked with Ace and...

INT. ACE'S TANGIERS PENTHOUSE, LAS VEGAS - DAY

ACE opens the door to NICKY and JENNIFER.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...nobody interfered with the fuckin' 
          skim.

                      ACE
               (Opening door)
          Hey.

                      JENNIFER
          Hey, how you doin'?
               (Kisses ACE.)

                      NICKY
          Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?

JENNIFER and NICKY take in ACE's spectacular Vegas-style 
penthouse.

                      JENNIFER
               (Whispering)
          Wow.

                      NICKY
          Boy, look at this place, huh?

                      JENNIFER
          Incredible.

                      NICKY
          All right.

                      ACE
          Welcome to Vegas.

CAMERA TILTS UP TO REVEAL A SWEEPING VIEW OF THE LAS VEGAS 
SKYLINE.

                      NICKY
          Okay, Sammy.

                      ACE
          Somethin', huh?

                      NICKY
          Yeah.

                      ACE
               (Calling her over)
          Ginger.

GINGER emerges from the bedroom. NICKY and JENNIFER are both 
stunned by her beauty.

                      NICKY
               (To ACE)
          Holy shit, what've you been doin' 
          out here?

                      ACE
          Honey, come here.

She walks to them

                      ACE
          This is Jennifer and Nick. They're 
          dear friends of mine.

                      JENNIFER
               (Shaking hands)
          Good to meet you.

                      GINGER
          Hi, Jennifer.

                      NICKY
          Pleasure.
               (Grasping GINGER's 
               hand and kissing it.)
          Very nice to meet you.

                      GINGER
          Hi, how are you?

                      NICKY
          Okay, Sammy.

INT. ACE'S CAR, LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT

ACE and NICKY are driving through town, the neon lights of 
Vegas reflected in the windshield.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          After we ate, we left Jennifer and 
          Ginger alone and we took a ride to 
          talk. And then... he hit me with it.

                      NICKY
          What do you think about me movin' 
          out here?
               (ACE looks away.)
          What's the matter? You got a problem 
          with that?

                      ACE
          No, of course not.

                      NICKY
               (Playfully)
          You mean, I have your permission?

                      ACE
          Sure, you have my permission. But I - 
          I just gotta tell you it's no joke 
          out here. It's no joke, you know?  
          You gotta keep a low profile. It's 
          not like back home. Right off the 
          bat, they don't like guys like us. 
          And this sheriff's a real cowboy. 
          Even the coppers aren't afraid to 
          bury people out in the desert here.

                      NICKY
          I don't care. I want to get away 
          from back home for a while. I'm tired 
          of that shit back there.
               (Referring to the 
               Vegas lights.)
          Look at this place. It's made of 
          money. You know what the best part 
          is? Nobody's gonna know what we're 
          doin'! There's nobody here to see 
          us! Everybody's back home.

                      ACE
          Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched 
          twice for no reason. You really gotta 
          be careful. I'm running a licensed 
          place. Everything's legit.

                      NICKY
          Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna 
          do anything. What am I gonna do?  
          I'm especially not gonna involve you 
          in anything.

ACE gives NICKY a look.

EXT./INT. LAS VEGAS SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT

NICKY and MARINO pull up in their car and get out.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Ace saw Vegas one way.

                      NICKY
          You call this guy and tell him I'm 
          comin'?

                      MARINO
          Of course.

They walk into the sportsbook, past numerous bar patrons and 
gamblers to TONY, the bookie at a betting counter.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But I saw it another. I saw it as 
          untouched. I mean, they had bookies, 
          pimps and drug dealers I could shake 
          down. Who the fuck were they gonna 
          run to?  So, I started getting 
          everybody in line. Best of all, for 
          the first time in my life, I figured 
          out a way not to lose.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, 
          all right. It wasn't very scientific 
          but it worked. When he won, he 
          collected. When he lost, he told the 
          bookies to go fuck themselves. What 
          were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?
               (Chuckles.)
          Nicky was the muscle.

NICKY grabs TONY by the back of his neck.

                      NICKY
          Tony.

                      TONY
          Hey.

                      NICKY
          How you doin'?

                      TONY
          How you doin'?

                      NICKY
          All right, yeah. You got that thing 
          for me?

                      TONY
          What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought 
          you was layin'.

                      NICKY
          I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. 
          I was takin' it.

                      TONY
          You sure?

                      NICKY
          I'm positive.

                      TONY
          Well, I'm a little confused here.

                      NICKY
          You're a little confused?

                      TONY
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
               (Pointing to a window, 
               above a counter with 
               a tiny opening to 
               talk through)
          Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face 
          through this window over here like, 
          you know, you'll - you'll get 
          unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money!

TONY takes some money out of his coat pocket.

                      TONY
               (Groaning)
          I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean 
          anything by it.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, I know, that's why you had it 
          ready. You thought I was fuckin' 
          layin' it?!

He smacks the bookie on the head with the wad of money.

                      TONY
               (Gasps)
          My fuckin' head.

                      NICKY
          Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck 
          around, Tony.

                      MARINO
               (Pointing to TONY)
          Smarten up.

                      NICKY
               (Walking out)
          You jag-off.

 

                      CLASSROOM NUN (O.S.)
               (From following scene)
          And now...

INT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

NICKY and JENNIFER stand in the background with other parents 
listening to a NUN school teacher. LITTLE NICKY and other 
youngsters are seated at small children's desks.

                      CLASSROOM NUN
          ...Nicholas Santoro will come up and 
          tell us about our first president.

                      LITTLE NICKY
               (Stepping up in front 
               of the class to begin 
               a speech)
          George Washington was born in a...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But still, it was nice and quiet for 
          a while. Ginger and I presented Nicky 
          and Jennifer all over town, like 
          regular Ozzie and Harriets.

                      LITTLE NICKY
          ...typical Virginia farmhouse.

EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY

NICKY and DETECTIVE BOB JOHNSON are coaching their sons. 
JOHNSON pats LITTLE NICKY on the back and with encouraging 
words sends him running on to the field.

                      DETECTIVE JOHNSON
               (To LITTLE NICKY)
          Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved 
          with Little League, and it was great.

                      DETECTIVE JOHNSON
          Now, I want you to get out there and 
          get me singles and doubles, okay?  
          'Cause that's what's gonna win this 
          game.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Turned out to be one of the other 
          coaches was a fuckin'...  

                      DETECTIVE JOHNSON
          Now go out there and show your dad 
          what you can do.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...metro intelligence cop. But it 
          didn't matter. I mean, it was all 
          about the kids, you know.

                      DETECTIVE JOHNSON
          You know, he's gotta realize 
          everything can't be a home run that 
          he does.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, well, that's exactly what I 
          keep tellin' him, but that's the 
          kind of kid he is ever since he's 
          born.

                      DETECTIVE JOHNSON
          It's instinctive, you know.

                      NICKY
          He tries to do everything...

LITTLE NICKY hits the ball, NICKY and DETECTIVE JOHNSON 
applaud.

                      NICKY
          Ohh!

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his 
          presence known.

INT. TANGIERS CASHIER'S CAGE CREDIT WINDOW - NIGHT

NICKY saunters through the casino and up to EDDY and JERRY, 
two well-dressed hoods who are signing papers at the cashier's 
credit window near ACE and SHERBERT.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Especially at the casino, where he 
          definitely did not work, people got 
          the message.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Me? That's why the bosses sent me 
          out here. They wanted me to make 
          sure none of the other crews robbed 
          the joint. Like these two fuckin' 
          balloon-heads over here [EDDY and 
          JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang 
          us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?
               (Chuckling.)
          Yeah, right, I'm sure.

                      JERRY
               (Shakes NICKY's hand)
          Hey, Nicky. How are you?

                      NICKY
          Hey, Eddy.

                      EDDY
          Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are 
          you doin' here?

                      NICKY
          I'm over here now.

                      JERRY/EDDY
               (In unison)
          You're over here?

                      JERRY
          You're over here?

                      NICKY
          Yeah, I'm over here with him.

SWISH PAN TO ACE WITH SHERBERT OFF TO THE SIDE.

                      EDDY
          Oh.

                      JERRY
          Oh.

                      EDDY
          We're waiting on Carmine.

                      JERRY
          Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.

                      NICKY
          Carmine? He was here before. I saw 
          him. He had a suitcase and everything, 
          and then he left.

                      EDDY
          Carmine left?

                      NICKY
          Uh-huh.

                      JERRY
          Carmine left?

                      EDDY
          He's gone?

                      JERRY
          He's not here?

                      EDDY
          Carmine's gone.

                      NICKY
          I think, you know, maybe he went 
          across the street or somewhere else 
          or somethin'. I don't know.

                      EDDY
          Well, listen, uh... Good luck with 
          the joint, huh?
               (Shakes hands with 
               NICKY.)

                      NICKY
          Oh, thanks, Eddy.

                      JERRY
               (Shakes NICKY's hand)
          Yeah, lots of luck. Lots of luck.

                      NICKY
          Hey, great, Jerry.

They walk away.

                      NICKY
          Good luck to you too.

                      CREDIT CLERK
               (To NICKY from behind 
               the cage)
          Hey, they forgot to sign their papers.

                      NICKY
          What?

                      CREDIT CLERK
          They forgot to sign their papers.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, they don't need those anymore.

He looks over to ACE and SHERBERT. NICKY smiles.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Out of respect, guys from other crews 
          got away with a warning.

ACE taking a drag off his cigarette, nods an 'okay'.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Everybody else: watch out.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO/BLACKJACK TABLES - DAY

A blackjack WINNER, who looks like a school teacher, with 
over $100,000 in chips before him has gathered a crowd.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Like these yokels here who never 
          heard of Nicky or the bosses back 
          home, 'cause they're the morons who 
          give you the most trouble. Even after 
          we'd catch 'em, they'd try sneakin' 
          back with beards and wigs and fake 
          noses.

ACE and SHERBERT walk up to watch the WINNER who is playing 
all six hands at the blackjack table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          You can spot these assholes by 
          watching the way they bet. Like this 
          guy. He's bettin' lavender chips at 
          five hundred each with only one little 
          problem. He's always guessed right.  
          If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy, he'd 
          have been tougher to spot. But in 
          the end, they're all greedy.

ACE walks around the WINNER's table, past the crowd, to the 
pit. Behind him are more blackjack tables, dealers and 
players. ACE bends down and ties his shoelace.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I saw that the dealer was weak, but 
          he wasn't in on it.

The DEALER's hands lift the corner of his hole card a half 
an inch to determine the casino's hand against the WINNER. 
The slightly exposed hole card is a six of clubs.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He just wasn't protecting his hand. 
          He was lifting his hole card way to 
          high.

ON ACE'S FACE THEN TO HIS POV OF THE CARD, PAST A PIT BOSS, 
PANNING TO THE SIGNALER AT THE BLACKJACK TABLE TO THE RIGHT. 
THE SIGNALER IS SLUMPED DOWN IN HIS SEAT, TOSSING DOWN SOME 
CARDS AND SNEAKING LOOKS AT THE DEALER'S HAND AT THE WINNER'S 
TABLE.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Now, here's this guy...

OVERHEAD PAN FROM THE SIGNALER SLUMPED IN HIS SEAT.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...reading the dealer's hole card...

PAN CONTINUES PAST ACE TO REVEAL THE WINNER'S TABLE.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...and signaling his buddy [the 
          WINNER] at this table.

OVERHEAD DOLLY IN ON SIGNALER WHO APPEARS TO BE NERVOUSLY 
TAPPING HIS THIGH.

We see through his trousers, that he is tapping a copper 
transmitter with a battery pack attached.

Back at the WINNER's table we see inside his pant leg where 
a device strapped to his leg is receiving the impulse signal - 
buzz - buzz - buzz - from the SIGNALER.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And that's just what these hustlers 
          look for. They cruise from casino to 
          casino, lookin' for weak dealers the 
          way lions look for weak antelope.

ACE starts to get up.

                      ACE (O.S.)
               (From following scene)
          Operator?

INT. TANGIERS BLACKJACK TABLES/TELEPHONE - DAY

ACE is on the house phone right near the SIGNALER's table.

                      ACE
          This is Mr R. Get me Armstrong and 
          Friday over at pit two right away.

He hangs up, and fixes his tie in the mirrored panel above 
the phone.

OVERHEAD VIEW OF THE SIGNALER'S TABLE. VARIOUS SECURITY GUARDS 
SLOWLY BEGIN TO GATHER AROUND IT.

ACE, waiting, lights a cigarette. ARMSTRONG joins ACE. They 
look towards the SIGNALER's table.

                      ACE
               (To ARMSTRONG)
          BJ nineteen, second base, the beard 
          [Blackjack table number 19, second 
          position, man with the beard]

                      ACE
               (Picks up the phone 
               again.)
          Operator... I need Mr Happy, loud.

On ACE's signal, WAITRESSES, one carrying a cake with a 
sparkling candle, start singing 'Happy Birthday', attracting 
the crowd's attention.

                      WAITRESSES
               (In unison)
          Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday 
          to you. Happy Birthday, dear Jeff. 
          Happy Birthday to you.

Gamblers cheer and applaud.

ACE nods and ARMSTRONG lets a long metal object drop out 
from under his jacket sleeve and moves in close behind the 
SIGNALER, as though looking at the game.

He presses the object - a cattle prod - under the SIGNALER's 
arm near his heart. The SIGNALER instantly goes into 
convulsions, falling to the floor gasping and groaning. 
Several SECURITY GUARDS grab the SIGNALER as he falls.  
ARMSTRONG walks away.

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Man down!

The WINNER sees what happened to his partner.

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Notify medical! We got a cardiac 
          arrest here!

                      SECURITY GUARD #2
          He's fine, folks. Just give us some 
          room, please!

ACE watches the scene. The guards lift the stunned SIGNALER 
to his feet and help him away from the table. Play is 
immediately resumed.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Watch it now.

The WINNER hurriedly places his chips into racks.

                      SECURITY GUARD #1 (O.S.)
          Stand back!

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They never know what hit them. And 
          if and when...

SECURITY GUARDS drag the SIGNALER out.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...they do find out they just got 
          zapped by a cattle prod...

SHERBERT follows the WINNER as he rushes away.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...they wish they really did have a 
          heart attack.

ACE exits behind the GUARDS and the SIGNALER.

INT. BASEMENT MAINTENANCE ROOM - NIGHT

A grim, windowless utility room with tools on racks along 
the walls, some plain wooden chairs, and a workbench table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Turns out this guy and his fuckin' 
          pals, they were knockin' this place 
          dead for years.

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          He's got a wire on him.

The SIGNALER is roughly shoved into the room. A SECURITY 
GUARD tears his trousers down revealing the signaling device 
strapped to his leg.

                      SIGNALER
          Hey, hey, what are you doin', man?

                      SECURITY GUARD #2
               (Exposing the device)
          There it is! On the table!

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Cheater's justice!

The SIGNALER is slammed down face first on the bench and the 
two GUARDS spread his arms out on the table.

                      SIGNALER
               (In pain)
          Oh, God! Oh!

Another GUARD starts up a power saw and approaches the 
SIGNALER who is now pinned to the table. He starts to scream.

                      SIGNALER
          Hey, no! No! No!

ACE walks toward the table, gesturing for the GUARD to turn 
off the saw.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          We had to make an example of these 
          pricks that the party was over.

                      ACE
               (To relieved SIGNALER)
          I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling 
          your checks with your right hand. 
          Can you do that with both hands?

                      SIGNALER
          No.

                      ACE
          Can't do it with both hands?

                      SIGNALER
          No, Sir.

                      ACE
          Can you do it with your left hand?

                      SIGNALER
          Well, I... I never tried.

                      ACE
          So, you're a righty?

                      SIGNALER
          Ye-yeah.

ACE nods to one of the GUARDS. Instantly a large rubber mallet 
smashes onto the man's right hand four times to the sound of 
screams. ACE watches.

                      ACE
          Now, you're gonna have to learn with 
          your left hand.

                      SIGNALER
          God!
               (He moans and sits 
               back.)

                      WINNER (O.S.)
               (From following scene)
          It's a hundred...

INT. CASINO CASHIER'S CAGE AREA - NIGHT

The WINNER has been standing outside the cashier's cage 
waiting for his $110,000 in chips to be cashed. SHERBERT 
walks up behind him.

                      WINNER
          ...a hundred ten.

                      CASHIER
          Yes, it is.

                      WINNER
          I think.

                      CASHIER
          Yes.

                      WINNER
          Okay.

                      SHERBERT
          Hiya. That's a lot of money to be 
          counting out in public.

                      WINNER
          Yeah.

                      SHERBERT
               (To CASHIER)
          Why don't I take him over to the 
          office and verify it, huh?

                      CASHIER
          Yes.

                      SHERBERT
          A little privacy. And, by the way, 
          send over a... nice bottle of 
          champagne on ice, huh?

                      CASHIER
          Sure will.

                      SHERBERT
          Real special.  Somethin'...
               (To WINNER.)
          By the way...  I'm Billy Sherbert, 
          your casino manager.

He shakes hands with the WINNER.

                      WINNER
          Hi.

                      SHERBERT
          Having a good time?

SHERBERT leads him away from the cage.

                      WINNER
          Yes, uh...

                      SHERBERT
          You'll want to count the money in 
          privacy. You know, you don't need...

                      WINNER
          Uh, I have a plane to catch to 
          Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?

INT. BASEMENT MAINTENANCE ROOM - NIGHT

The WINNER is pushed through the door by two GUARDS followed 
by SHERBERT and sees his pal moaning in pain and holding his 
broken hand.

                      SIGNALER
          Look what they did to my hand, man!

                      ACE
               (Walks over to the 
               WINNER)
          All right, I'm gonna give you a 
          choice. You can either have the money 
          and the hammer or you can walk out 
          of here. You can't have both. What 
          do you want?

SHERBERT stands next to the WINNER

                      WINNER
          I just wanna get out of here.

                      ACE
          And don't forget to tell your friends 
          what happens if they fuck around in 
          here. You understand?

                      WINNER
          I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.

                      ACE
          You're fuckin' right, you made a bad 
          mistake. 'Cause if you come back 
          here - we catch either one of you - 
          we're gonna break your fuckin' heads 
          and you won't walk out of here. You 
          see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna 
          use it. You don't fuck around in 
          this place. You got it?

                      WINNER
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          Get out of here.

                      WINNER
          Thank you.

The GUARDS usher the WINNER out of the room.

                      ACE
               (To the GUARDS, 
               referring to the 
               SIGNALER)
          Throw him out in the alley.  And 
          just tell the cops he got hit by a 
          car.

INT. ACE'S TANGIERS PENTHOUSE

ACE and GINGER are alone in the living room. The apartment 
looks out on the glittering neon signs of the Strip.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Within no time, everything was set 
          in place. We got rid of the freelance 
          scamsters. The per was way up.  The 
          gods were happy, or as happy as the 
          gods can ever be.  And I, I decided 
          to complicate my life. For a guy who 
          likes sure things, I was about to 
          bet the rest of my life on a real 
          longshot.

                      ACE
          We're not getting any younger. Don't 
          you think it's time? Aren't you 
          gettin' tired of all this shit? 
          Bangin' around, hustlin' around?

                      GINGER
          What, are you trying to handicap me?

                      ACE
          I'm gonna do you one better. I'm 
          trying to marry you. You want to 
          marry me?
               (GINGER looks doubtful.)
          I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to 
          settle down. I want a family.

                      GINGER
               (Sighs, laughing)
          You got the wrong girl, Sam.

                      ACE
          I know I'd be a good father. I know 
          you'd be a good mother.

                      GINGER
          You don't know me. What, you've known 
          me, two, three months. What do you 
          know?

                      ACE
          I'm forty-three years old. I don't 
          want to wait. I know you well enough 
          to know that I really love you very 
          much.  And I can't think of anybody 
          better to be with. And I don't feel 
          like waiting anymore.

                      GINGER
          You know a lot of happily married 
          people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.

                      ACE
          Yeah, I know all that.

                      GINGER
          I care about you, a - But I just 
          don't have those kind of feelings 
          for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love 
          with you.

                      ACE
               (Brushing cigarette 
               ash off his dressing 
               gown)
          I - I - I...

                      GINGER
          Understand?
               (Pause)
          I'm sorry.

                      ACE
          No, I - I... mean...  that can grow 
          as I - as long as there's a mutual 
          respect... that kind of thing can 
          grow. I'm realistic. I can accept 
          that. But, you know, what is...  
          What is love anyway?  It's a... it's 
          a mutual respect. It's - it's a 
          devotion. It's a... it's a caring 
          from one person to another. And if 
          we could set up some kind of 
          foundation...  based on that mutual 
          respect...  I feel that eventually 
          you would care enough about me... 
          that I could live with that.

                      GINGER
          If it doesn't work out. You know, if 
          it doesn't play out, then what happens 
          to me?

                      ACE
          You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm 
          gonna do even better. And so, whatever 
          happens, if it doesn't work out 
          between us, I'm gonna make sure you're 
          okay for the rest of your life. And 
          if there are kids, especially, you 
          know, I'll take care of you better 
          than you'd ever imagine.

                      GINGER
               (Interrupts)
          What're you... what're you pitching 
          me, here?

                      ACE
          Just what I said. You'll be set up 
          for the rest of your life. That I 
          can promise you.
               (Pause)
          Want to take a chance?

She looks at him. ACE is holding her hand tightly.

INT. RIVIERA BALLROOM MARRIAGE - NIGHT

ACE and GINGER are seated at a banquet table with various 
guests, drinking champagne. AMY, their six-month-old child 
is in a cradle. NICKY and JENNIFER are hovering around the 
baby with LITTLE NICKY and are blissfully happy. It is an 
elegant affair.  City Officials, politicians and gaming 
officials are there, plus, SHERBERT and Ace's boss, PHILIP 
GREEN. A photographer takes pictures of the guests.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          When I married Ginger I knew all the 
          stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 
          'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can 
          change her.'

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          It was typical Ace. He invited the 
          biggest people in town and he knew 
          they'd show. Because he knew they 
          all wanted somethin' from him.  With 
          Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. 
          Even Ginger. With her -

We see AMY in the cradle.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          - he still covered his bets. They 
          had to have the baby first, before 
          they got married. Even made Jennie 
          and me watch Amy for a few days when 
          they went on their honeymoon. But I 
          didn't mind, we loved the kid.

IN SLOW MOTION CAMERA MOVES IN ON ACE AND GINGER, STANDING 
NEXT TO A LARGE WEDDING CAKE. THEY ARE KISSING. NICKY, 
SHERBERT AND OTHER GUESTS LOOK ON.

CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER AS THEY KISS, THEN PAST THEM TO THE 
BRIDE AND GROOM FIGURINES ON THE CAKE.

LESTER's and GINGER's telephone conversation is heard in 
voice-over this scene.

                      LESTER
               (Over telephone)
          Can you feel my eyes on you? Can you 
          feel me look into your heart?  Can 
          you feel me in the pit of your 
          stomach? Can you feel me in you? In 
          your heart?

We see a wide view of the elaborate wedding, guests mill 
about the banquet hall.

                      LESTER
          Don't make me come there. Answer me.

                      GINGER
               (Over telephone, 
               sobbing)
          I love you.

INT. LESTER DIAMOND'S LOS ANGELES APARTMENT - NIGHT

LESTER DIAMOND is talking on the phone softly, cutting up 
cocaine on a piece of glass.

                      LESTER
               (Into telephone)
          Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I 
          love you too?

                      GINGER
               (Over telephone)
          No, Lester.

                      LESTER
               (Into telephone)
          Do you know that?

                      GINGER
               (Over telephone)
          Yeah. This is the best thing I can 
          do for my life right now.

                      LESTER
               (Into telephone)
          That's right.

INT. RIVIERA BALLROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT

GINGER is sitting alone on the phone. She's crying.

                      LESTER
               (Over telephone)
          So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing, into 
               telephone)
          Promise?

                      LESTER
               (Over telephone)
          God... I wish you...

INT. LESTER DIAMOND'S LOS ANGELES APARTMENT - NIGHT

There is a beautiful scantily dressed blonde girl in the 
apartment with him. She bends down to the table in front of 
him, snorts some cocaine, then walks away.

                      LESTER
               (Into telephone)
          ...all the luck in the world.

                      GINGER
               (Over telephone)
          You do?

                      LESTER
               (Into telephone)
          Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the - 
          it's the best thing you can do right 
          now. I mean this. And you'll have 
          real security.  Sweetheart... you're 
          gonna be situated just right in Vegas.

INT. RIVIERA BALLROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT

ACE enters from the ballroom and sees GINGER on the phone. 
He walks towards her, listening to her conversation.

                      LESTER
               (Over telephone)
          Come on, this is great for us. You 
          know I'm gonna be here for you. I 
          ain't going no place. Huh?  I'm 
          lookin' at you right now. I'm seein' 
          you for the very first time, right 
          this minute. I'm seein' you, and I 
          can feel my heart click. I see you 
          fourteen years old. I see you the 
          first second I ever saw you. I see 
          you, long-legged little colt -

GINGER notices ACE behind her.

                      LESTER
          - with stupid braces on your teeth.

                      GINGER
               (Into telephone, 
               sniffing, trying to 
               cut him off)
          Okay, then.

                      LESTER
               (Over telephone)
          Every time I ever see you, that's 
          what I see.

                      GINGER
               (Into telephone)
          Uh, talk to you later.  Bye.
               (She hangs up the 
               phone quickly.)

                      ACE
          You all right?

                      GINGER
               (Drinking some 
               champagne, wiping 
               away tears)
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          Why're you crying?

                      GINGER
               (Laughs)
          I'm not crying.
               (Sniffs.)

ACE walks up behind GINGER.

                      ACE
          Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.

                      GINGER
          I'm okay. I just -
               (Sniffs)
          You just have to understand. I've 
          been with Lester since I was a kid. 
          I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I 
          just...  I don't... I think I have a 
          right to do that. Okay?

                      ACE
          It's all right. That part of your 
          life is over with. Right?

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          You're with me now.

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          Right?

                      GINGER
          Uh-huh.

                      ACE
          You sure?

                      GINGER
          Yeah. Yeah.

They are reflected in a mirror behind the telephone.

                      ACE
          Want to go? Let's go back in.

                      GINGER
               (Sniffs)
          Okay.

ACE's hands pick up a white rose and GINGER's gloves from 
the desk.

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - DAY

ACE and GINGER drive up to an expensive house which backs on 
to a country-club golf course.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE - DAY

ACE takes GINGER inside. It is fancy and lush.

                      GINGER
          Oh...

Through sliding glass doors, we see a patio and a pool area.

                      GINGER
               (Sighing)
          It's great.

The living-room has exposed white brick along the walls, 
bronze ostrich figurines, a white baby grand piano, and a 
zebra print rug surrounded by a few couches.

                      GINGER
          Oh, it's great.

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM CLOSET - DAY

ACE takes GINGER past the bedroom to their huge room-sized 
closet. There are racks and racks of clothes.

                      GINGER
               (Running into the 
               closet)
          Oh! It's all my stuff. Oh, my God.

ACE presents her with a long chinchilla coat.

                      GINGER
          You brought all my stuff. I can -

She sees the coat.

                      ACE
          Try it on. It's yours.

He puts it on her.

                      GINGER
               (Whispering)
          You're kidding? My God. What is it?

                      ACE
          It's chinchilla.

                      GINGER
               (Looking at herself 
               in the mirror)
          Oh, it's so soft.

                      ACE
          It's nice isn't it?

                      GINGER
          Oh...

ACE Kisses her.

                      GINGER
          No one's ever been so nice to me.

They kiss and embrace.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - DAY

ACE's hand opens a leather case full of gold Bvlgari jewelry.

                      GINGER
               (Gasps)
          Oh, my God.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - DAY

ACE and GINGER lie on the bed, surrounded by jewelry. GINGER 
is swathed in the chinchilla coat. Ace watches as a transfixed 
GINGER tries on gold necklaces, rings, bracelets and earrings.

                      GINGER
          So, do you think it's too much if I 
          wear these in the same day?

                      ACE
          You do whatever you want. Do I keep 
          my promises, or do I keep my promises?

ACE kisses GINGER.

                      GINGER
          You're so wonderful. The jewelry's 
          not so bad, either.

                      ACE
          The only thing is... you shouldn't 
          keep this in the house. We gotta put 
          it in a bank.

                      GINGER
               (Putting on a gold 
               bracelet)
          Come on. Can I keep this one in the 
          house?

                      ACE
          Now look,
               (gently holding her 
               face, gathering her 
               total attention)
          pay attention to me. What I'm gonna
           tell you is very important.

                      GINGER
          Okay.

                      ACE
          All this stuff doesn't mean anything. 
          Money, this, doesn't mean anything 
          without trust. I have to be able to 
          trust you with my life.

EXT. BURBANK PRIVATE AIRPORT - DAY

TITLE IN: 'LOS ANGELES'

ACE and GINGER get off the Tangiers jet carrying two 
suitcases. ACE gives a chauffeur the luggage and follows 
GINGER into a brown Rolls Royce.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          With over a million in cash and jewels 
          tucked in a bank in Vegas only for 
          Ginger, she was secure and happy.

INT. BEVERLEY HILLS BANK - DAY

ACE and GINGER walk into the bank lobby carrying the 
suitcases.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She loved that shit. But a guy in my 
          line of work has to have a lot of 
          pay-off cash around.

INT. BEVERLEY HILLS BANK/VAULT - DAY

There are several safe deposit boxes filled with cash. ACE 
and GINGER are closing a large box so crammed with cash that 
ACE has to lean on it for the clasp to lock.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Crooked cops and kidnappers, they 
          don't take checks.

                      GINGER
          Need a little help with that, Mr 
          Collins?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          So, I put two million in cash in a 
          Los Angeles bank under the name of 
          Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was 
          strictly my shakedown and kidnapping 
          money.

ACE and GINGER struggle to push the crammed box into a slot 
in the wall.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And, since I'd either be in jail or 
          locked in a closet when I needed the 
          money the most...

The BANK PRESIDENT joins them, and he and ACE simultaneously 
double-lock the outer safe box door with two separate keys, 
after which, ACE gives GINGER his key.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...I gave Ginger the only key to the 
          cash that could get me back alive.

INT. BANK PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY

GINGER is on the other side of a glass wall, signing papers.

                      BANKER
          Now this is just a signature card.

                      ACE
          So, once she signs those papers, 
          she'll be the only person to have 
          total access to the box?  No one 
          else, including myself?

                      BANKER
          That's right.

We see GINGER looking at ACE.

                      BANKER
          That's the way you wanted it, right?

ACE nods

                      BANKER
               (Quietly.)
          Sam, let me ask you a question. You 
          must really trust your wife.

                      ACE
               (Quietly)
          Yeah, sure I do. Why?

                      BANKER
          No, tha-that's good. It's just 
          unusual. To tell you the truth, so 
          many of my clients don't.

                      ACE
          Well...

ACE looks over to GINGER, smiles and winks. She looks back 
at him.

INT. TANGIERS LOUNGE - NIGHT

JERRY VALE sings to a seated audience. ACE sits alone at a 
table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          With Ginger and the money in place, 
          I felt covered, and to play it safe 
          I switched job titles again and made 
          myself, um, Food and Beverage 
          Director. This way nobody would bother 
          me about a license. I mean, Vegas 
          was like a dream for me. Trouble 
          was...

NICKY is seated at another table with MARINO, peeling off 
money and giving it to MIKE, a crooked dealer.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind 
          of Vegas.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          To begin, I put money out on the 
          streets, chargin' three points a 
          week. You know - juice to the fuckin' 
          dealers.

                      MARINO
               (To MIKE)
          Don't make us come lookin' for you.

                      MIKE
          Oh, you won't have to look for me. I 
          appreciate it. Thanks, Nicky.

                      NICKY
          All right, Mike.

MIKE gets up from the table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          They were degenerate gamblers, coke 
          freaks. In no time, I had half the 
          dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket.  
          Then...

INT. TANGIERS POKER TABLE - NIGHT

NICKY is at a table with his gang of card sharks: SLIM, ROCKY, 
MOOSH and COWBOY, all secretly signaling each other, 
sandbagging a mark. MIKE, the crooked dealer from the previous 
scene, deals NICKY a winning hand.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...the next thing I did, I started 
          bustin' out high-stakes poker players.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          It was so obvious. I mean, all of 
          Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they 
          were real signal happy.

                      MOOSH
               (Scratching his arm)
          I'm gonna open for five hundred.

                      ROCKY
          Moosh, you open?
               (Taps his fingers on 
               some chips before 
               picking them up.)

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Signaling back and forth.

                      CARD SHARK
          I bet thirty-five hundred.

NICKY wiggles a toothpick back and forth in his mouth.

                      DOCTOR DAN
          I've been losing for three days 
          straight, non-stop.

Another shark pulls on his ear.

                      ROCKY
          Oh, why're you crying, with three 
          loaves of bread under your arm?

ACE watches their signals with concern.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Nicky thought nobody was watching 
          him. But he was wrong.

We see two undercover gaming agents, looking like tourists, 
sneaking looks at NICKY's table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And I didn't want any of those agents 
          near my place.

                      NICKY
          Four aces, Doc.

His hands spread five cards on the table, showing four aces.

                      NICKY
          What do you got?

                      DOCTOR DAN
               (Getting up in disgust)
          Jesus Christ. I can't believe it.

COWBOY, the card shark with the cowboy hat, rakes in a large 
pot toward his side of the table.

                      DOCTOR DAN
          If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't 
          have any luck. I'm out of here, you 
          understand?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, I wished to God Nicky and 
          his whole crew would just get lost.

He walks towards NICKY's table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          What am I gonna do? Go back home and 
          start a war?

ACE leans down to talk to NICKY.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm 
          not. I can't do that.

                      ACE
               (Whispering in NICKY's 
               ear)
          Be careful. Gaming agents are all 
          over the place.

                      NICKY
          So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to 
          get lucky in this place?

                      ACE
          You been lucky all week. They're 
          lookin' to nail ya.

ACE walks away. NICKY looks over at the gaming agents.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Ace was so fuckin' worried about his 
          casino, he forgot what we were doin' 
          out here in the first place.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

Security people are pulling apart a husband and wife who are 
fighting. Camera picks up ACE as he passes by them.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          A million times I wanted to yell in 
          his fuckin' ear: 'This is Las Vegas!  
          We're supposed to be out here robbin', 
          you dumb fuckin' Heeb.'

INT. TANGIERS CASINO POKER TABLE - NIGHT

Closeup of the COWBOY's white-socked feet with no shoes on a 
poker table.

                      ACE
               (To SHERBERT, referring 
               to COWBOY)
          I don't give a shit who he's connected 
          to. Tell him to take his fuckin' 
          feet off the table. What's he think 
          this is, a goddamn sawdust joint?

SHERBERT approaches COWBOY.

                      SHERBERT
          Sir, would you mind taking your feet 
          off the table and putting your shoes 
          on, please?

                      COWBOY
               (Sighs)
          Yeah, I would mind. I'm havin' a bad 
          night.

COWBOY remains the same with his feet on the table.

                      SHERBERT
               (Returning to ACE)
          Fuckin' asshole won't budge.

                      ACE
          Call security.

ACE approaches COWBOY.

                      ACE
          How are you?

                      COWBOY
          Good. How are you?

                      ACE
          Good. You want to do me a favor? You 
          want to take your feet off the table 
          and put your shoes back on?

                      COWBOY
          Fuck you.

ACE walks to nearby SECURITY GUARDS.

                      ACE
               (To GUARDS)
          I want you to exit this guy off the 
          premises, and I want you to exit him 
          off his feet and use his head to 
          open the fuckin' door.

Three SECURITY GUARDS approach COWBOY.

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You 
          mind accompanying us outside?

                      COWBOY
          Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere 
          with you!

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!

SECURITY GUARD #1 knocks his feet off the table, as GUARDS 
#2 and #3 lift him off his seat.

                      COWBOY
          Fuck you! Fuck you!

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Yeah?

                      COWBOY
          You know who you're fuckin' with?! 
          Huh? Do you?!

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Now move along.

                      COWBOY
               (Screaming at ACE who 
               follows him)
          You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who 
          you're fuckin' with?

The GUARDS carry him out and forcefully shove him towards a 
side exit.

                      COWBOY
          Leave me alone!

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Here we go!

                      COWBOY
               (Grunting)
          You've gotta be kidding me!
               (Groans.)

The GUARDS lift him off his feet and, holding him like a 
battering ram, smash his head into the door.

                      ACE (V.O.)
               (As COWBOY is thrown 
               out the door)
          Sure enough, an hour later, I get 
          the call.

INT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

NICKY is on a public wall-phone talking to ACE. MARINO is 
staring at the disheveled COWBOY.

                      NICKY
               (Into telephone)
          Ace, what happened over there? I 
          mean, did you know that guy you threw 
          out was with me?

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

ACE is on a Tangiers house phone. SHERBERT looks on.

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          No, I didn't know that. But you know 
          what he did?

                      NICKY
               (Over telephone)
          No.

INT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

NICKY gives COWBOY a look.

                      ACE
               (Over telephone)
          He insulted Billy. And then I walked 
          over to him politely...

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          ...and he tells me to go fuck myself.

                      NICKY
               (Over telephone)
          What?

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Then he called me a faggot.

INT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

                      ACE
               (Over telephone)
          So what do you think I do? I threw 
          that cocksucker out.

                      NICKY
               (Into telephone)
          What? Ho-
               (He puts down the 
               phone; to COWBOY:)
          Hey, come here.

COWBOY walks up to him.

                      NICKY
          You called my friend a faggot? You 
          tell him to go fuck himself?

                      COWBOY
          Nicky, I did -

                      NICKY
          Is that what you did?

                      COWBOY
          I did - I didn't -

                      NICKY
          Tell him to go fuck himself? You 
          fuckin' hick!  Fuckin'...

NICKY hits him on the head with the phone. COWBOY falls back, 
groaning.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

ACE listens to the noise of NICKY roughing up COWBOY.

                      NICKY
               (Over telephone)
          ...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come 
          here. Come here. Get him up. Come 
          here.

ACE LOOKS AT SHERBERT.

                      MARINO
               (Over telephone)
          Get up.

INT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

                      NICKY
               (To COWBOY)
          Come here, come here.

                      MARINO
          Get up.

                      NICKY
          You go over there right now and you 
          apologize. You better hope he lets 
          you back in.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

                      NICKY
               (Over telephone)
          If you ever get out of line over 
          there again, I'll smash your fuckin' 
          head so hard...

INT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

                      NICKY
               (To COWBOY)
          ...you won't be able to get that 
          cowboy hat on. You hear me? Fuckin' 
          hick.
               (Into telephone)
          Sammy, listen...

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

                      NICKY
               (Over telephone)
          ...this guy obviously doesn't know 
          who he was talkin' to, you understand? 
          He doesn't...

INT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

                      NICKY
               (Into telephone)
          ...know that, uh, we're dear friends. 
          I mean, he's already very sorry. 
          But, uh, if you could do me a favor 
          to let him back in, I swear to you 
          he'll never get out of line again. I 
          promise you that.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          If he does it again, he's out for 
          good. I don't care what it is, Nick, 
          I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let 
          him in the place again.

                      NICKY
               (Over telephone)
          I'm sorry about this. Really.

INT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

                      NICKY
               (Into telephone)
          All right, Ace?

                      ACE
               (Over telephone)
          Okay.

                      NICKY
               (Into telephone)
          Thanks, pal.

NICKY hangs up the phone and turns to COWBOY.

                      NICKY
          You took your boots off? You put 
          your feet on the table... you shit-
          kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' 
          motherfucker you!  You fuck me up 
          over there, I'll stick you in a hole 
          in the fuckin' desert! You understand?
               (Slapping him.)
          Go over there and apologize.
               (Kicking the chastened 
               COWBOY away.)
          Go! Get the fuck out of -

                      COWBOY
          Nicky, I'm sorry.

EXT. TANGIERS CASINO - DAY

A tiger leaps towards the camera, which pans over to two 
showgirls and then to ACE's hand holding the key to a Rolls 
Royce. He gives it to JONATHAN and DAVID as reporters rush 
in to photograph the moment.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          You know, Ace could be a very touchy 
          guy, especially when he got bigger 
          and bigger in town. Like when he 
          hired that Jonathon and David and 
          their tigers away from the Palace by 
          buildin' them a new stage and then 
          givin' them a silver Rolls Royce.

INT. BACKSTAGE TANGIERS THEATER - DAY

ACE and SHERBERT watch as a STAGE MANAGER weighs in the 'Femme 
Fatale' Showgirls.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But I'll tell you, he knew how to 
          bring in the crowds. He knew all the 
          fuckin' angles. He brought over the 
          whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. 
          But he forgot how lazy them European 
          dancin' broads can get. I mean, he 
          had to weigh 'em in once a week to 
          make sure they didn't blow up like 
          fuckin' balloons.

                      ACE
               (To SHOWGIRL)
          You're still eight pounds over.
               (To MANAGER.)
          What's the reason for this?

                      STAGE MANAGER
          Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on 
          suspension.

                      ACE
          Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 
          'sir'.

                      STAGE MANAGER
          Well, sir, I was just...

                      ACE
          Why is she eight pounds over?

                      STAGE MANAGER
          ...trying to offer you the respect 
          that your...

                      ACE
          I...

                      STAGE MANAGER
          ...position...

                      ACE
          'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.

                      STAGE MANAGER
          Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, 
          when you reach that pressure point, 
          when you put that pressure point on 
          them, you know, it shows...

                      ACE
          She could at least lose half a pound 
          or a quarter.  Listen...

                      STAGE MANAGER
          ...and she doesn't always -

                      ACE
          ...all you do is give me answers. 
          Just - just give me the right answer.

                      STAGE MANAGER
          But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I 
          guess, maybe, because she's frightened 
          that if she doesn't lose the weight 
          she may even get fired.

                      ACE
          That's right. She will get fired. In 
          fact, I want you to send her back to 
          Paris.

                      STAGE MANAGER
          It's always been our policy -

                      ACE
          No. Just stop everything.

SHERBERT and ACE walk away across a huge stage.

                      SHERBERT
               (To ACE)
          This woman's an institution.

                      ACE
          I don't care what she is. She's an 
          institution, that's the problem. 
          She's lazy.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT

ACE standing in a large space surrounded by giant TV screens 
showing sports events. Around him, long rows of bettors are 
seated at betting stations, lined up at windows, or wandering 
around at the bar. It's like a NASA control room on launch 
day.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He 
          does the most obvious thing. This is 
          the only town in the country where a 
          bookie joint is legit, so, why not 
          take advantage, right?  So... he 
          took bookie joints off the street 
          and then opened them up inside the 
          casino. Well, within a few years, by 
          doin' all of this, he had every casino 
          on the Strip trying to copy off him.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Between...

EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

NICKY, with MARINO, punching and kicking a man next to the 
open door of his luxury car.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...my innovations...

The man falls to the ground.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...and Nicky's dedication to his 
          job...

NICKY starts kicking him.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...I soon had the best operation on 
          the Strip.

NICKY lifts an empty trash can and shatters the car's 
windshield.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

ACE and NICKY are standing on the casino floor near the slot-
machines. Gamblers are milling about behind them.

                      ACE
          You better watch yourself. There's a 
          lot of heat on you already.

                      NICKY
          Why, somebody's complaining?

                      ACE
          I'm - I'm hearin' things from 
          security. They're all ex-cops. The 
          Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. 
          They want to put you in the Black 
          Book.

                      NICKY
          That Black Book is a bunch of 
          bullshit. They got two names in there 
          for the whole country and one of 
          them is still Al Capone.

                      ACE
          Bullshit or no bullshit, they put 
          you in that book, you're gonna be in 
          a lot of trouble. You will not be 
          able to walk into the casino. I'm 
          tellin' you.

                      NICKY
          What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' 
          to make a livin', that's all.

                      ACE
          I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I 
          didn't warn you.

                      NICKY
          All right.

INT. VEGAS VALLEY COUNTRY CLUB, 1974 - NIGHT

Tight on the filaments of a flash bulb as they ignite.

TV news crews and still photographers are taking pictures of 
ACE and GINGER surrounded by clusters of celebrities and the 
Vegas power elite, including SHERBERT and GREEN, at a black 
tie event.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER #1
          Mrs Rothstein, look straight ahead. 
          Very nice. Thank you.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER #2
          Thank you.

          Yes, nice smile.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER #3
          Just look right at the camera. Hold 
          that pose.

We hear GREEN making a speech over flashing cameras and freeze 
frames of himself, SHERBERT, ACE and GINGER.

                      GREEN (O.S.)
          Considering all of his hard work and 
          dedication and the new lifeblood he 
          has instilled in Las Vegas...

We now see GREEN at a mike speaking in front of the seated 
club members.

                      GREEN
          Sam has established himself as an 
          indispensable member of the gaming 
          community. As the head of the Tangiers 
          Gaming Corporation, it's my pleasure 
          to welcome Sam Rothstein to the Vegas 
          Valley Country Club.

Members cheer and applaud as GREEN hands ACE a framed 
citation. It reads: 'This Certificate of Appreciation. Sam 
Rothstein. Charitable Foundations of Greater Las Vegas'. 
They shake hands for the photographers.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Back home, they would have put me in 
          jail for what I'm doing. But out 
          here, they're givin' me awards.

                      ACE
               (Into the microphone)
          It's with great pleasure that I accept 
          this certificate of appreciation 
          from the...

INT. VEGAS VALLEY COUNTRY-CLUB BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT

A dazzling GINGER moves charmingly about the room chatting 
up top executives, lawyers, judges, bankers and their wives. 
ACE, standing with GREEN and an elderly man, watches her 
work the room.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #1
          Congratulations, sweetheart.

                      GINGER
          Thank you.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #2
          Sam raised more than we've ever raised 
          before.

                      GINGER
          He worked so hard.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But my greatest pleasure was watchin' 
          my wife, Ginger, work the room.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB MAN #1
          Thank you for everything.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They all loved her. How could you 
          not live her?

                      GINGER
               (To COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN 
               #3)
          Hi. Nice to see you.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She could be the most charming woman 
          you ever saw. People loved to be 
          around her.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3
          Listen, you've got to bring Amy to 
          Sasha's birthday party because he'd 
          love to have her there.

                      GINGER
          Thanks.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3
          We'll see you three o'clock Saturday.

                      GINGER
          Thanks. Yes, all right.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3
          Great.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She made everybody feel good.

GINGER joins ACE. He smiles proudly.

INT. VEGAS VALLEY COUNTRY-CLUB BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT

GINGER and ACE are off alone by a dining-room table, talking 
intently. A young casino EXECUTIVE interrupts them.

                      EXECUTIVE
          Congratulations, Sam.

                      ACE
               (Shaking his hand)
          Oh, thanks.

The flirting EXECUTIVE looks at GINGER.

                      EXECUTIVE
          Hello, Mrs Rothstein.

                      GINGER
          Hi.

                      EXECUTIVE
          How are you?

                      GINGER
          Oh.

GINGER gives the flirting EXECUTIVE her hand, he kisses it.

                      EXECUTIVE
          You're one of the most gorgeous women 
          I've ever seen. You're a lucky man 
          Mr Rothstein.

ACE watches as GINGER flashes one of her dazzling smiles, 
but he's not sure whether she's flirting. He looks at the 
young man and back at his wife.

                      ACE
          Thank you. Thanks for that compliment.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He was a young kid from the casino... 
          nice kid...  bright boy. What balls 
          on this fuckin' kid! The next day I 
          fired him.

Freeze frame on ACE smiling at GINGER.

INT. VEGAS BANK VIEWING ROOM - DAY

GINGER, with two-year-old AMY in a stroller, is seated on a 
bench going through large bank vault boxes containing her 
jewels.

                      GINGER
               (To AMY)
          Hey, do you want to see this one? 
          Daddy gave me all this jewelry because 
          he loves me so much. (She places a 
          gold bracelet on AMY's hand.) Put 
          your arm in there.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But as much as they loved her...

                      GINGER
               (To AMY, wearing the 
               bracelet)
          Oh, fabulous.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...they didn't know what really moved 
          her.

She holds up a necklace to the light.

                      GINGER
          Look at this. Look at this.

CAMERA PULLS AWAY FROM THE DOOR LEADING TO THE VIEWING ROOM

ACE is talking to DON WARD.

                      WARD
          Loose machines are right back over 
          there.

                      ACE
          What are they doin' way back there? 
          Bring 'em up here where they belong.  
          You can't even see 'em over there.

                      WARD
          Okay, I'll -

                      ACE
          What about the progressives with the 
          high jackpots? Where are they? These 
          machines are hidden.

                      WARD
          Well...

                      ACE
          These are our best machines. They 
          bring all the action. No wonder the 
          drop is off.

                      WARD
          Yeah, okay.

                      ACE
          The action is in the front, not in 
          the back. Bring 'em up front.

                      WARD
          All right, I will, I will.

                      ACE
          Listen to me very carefully. There 
          are three ways of doing things around 
          here. The right way, the wrong way, 
          and the way I do it. You understand?

                      WARD
          I do understand that. I'll get right 
          on it. And thank you.

                      ACE
          Don't thank me, just do it. You're 
          the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have 
          to tell you this.

                      WARD
          Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I 
          am so sorry.

INT. CLASSY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

GINGER follows a snooty MAITRE D' to JENNIFER, already seated 
at a table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          So, I ended up workin' what? Eighteen-
          hour days?  Ginger was the one who 
          wound up enjoying the best of Vegas.

                      MAITRE D'
               (To JENNIFER)
          Come with me, please. I have a better 
          table for you.  Sorry.

He shows the two of them to the best table in the place.

                      JENNIFER
               (Sitting down next to 
               GINGER)
          So, what'd you say to that fuckin' 
          jerk anyway?

                      GINGER
               (Smiling)
          I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.

                      JENNIFER
               (Chuckles)
          Well, you might as well get somethin' 
          out of it.

GINGER lights a cigarette.

EXT. IDLE SPURS DESERT DINER - DAY

Wide overhead of roadhouse cafe isolated in the middle of 
the desert with a sign out front that reads '60 miles to 
Vegas'.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Well, it wasn't long before what I 
          was afraid was gonna happen, happened. 
          Nicky managed to get himself banned 
          from every casino in Las Vegas, and 
          from then on, I couldn't be seen 
          talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or 
          even near it.

                      NICKY
               (From inside the diner)
          What the fuck is that supposed to 
          mean?

INT. IDLE SPURS DESERT DINER - DAY

ACE and NICKY are seated at a table in the empty diner.

                      NICKY
               (Reading from a 
               document)
          ' ...detrimental to gaming. And he 
          will be ejected from any casino in 
          Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be 
          fined as much as a hundred thousand 
          every time he shows up.'
               (He waves the document.)
          Do you believe this shit?

                      ACE
               (Smoking a cigarette)
          Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.

NICKY hisses.

                      NICKY
               (Reading)
          'Who is of notorious and unsavory 
          reputation...'

He angrily wads the document and tosses it across the table.

                      NICKY
          Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... 
          Is there any way around this?

                      ACE
          Nope, there's no way.

                      NICKY
          Let's say... for instance... I want 
          to go in the restaurant which happens 
          to be in the casino... to get one of 
          those sandwiches I like?

                      ACE
          Forget it. You can't even set foot 
          in the parking lot. That's how serious 
          it is.

                      NICKY
          In other words, I'm fucked.

                      ACE
          In so many words, yes.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          It just didn't sink into his head 
          about the Black Book and what it 
          meant. Not being able to go into a 
          casino is just one thing, but being 
          in this book etched your name into 
          the brains of every cop and FBI agent 
          in the state. I mean, you're listed 
          in there with Al Capone. But Nicky 
          didn't care.

                      NICKY
          I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do 
          somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of 
          me. They're not gettin' rid of me. 
          I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 
          'em.

EXT. GOLD RUSH JEWELER'S - DAY

WE MOVE PAST THE SKULL OF A STEER MOUNTED ON AN EXTERIOR 
WALL AND A WOODEN CIGAR STORE INDIAN STATUE, TO REVEAL 
DOMINICK SANTORO (WHO LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE HIS BROTHER NICKY) 
AND MARINO WHO ARE WAITING INSIDE THE GOLD RUSH. CAMERA COMES 
TO REST ON EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF NICKY'S EYES AS HE STANDS ON 
THE OUTSIDE PORCH.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          So, once they pulled that shit, I 
          started doin' my own things in Vegas 
          nobody ever thought of doin'. To 
          keep an eye on things, I brought in 
          my kid brother Dominick... and some 
          desperadoes from back home and started 
          knockin' over high rollers, casino 
          bosses, bookmakers, anybody, right 
          here in town. I had a good fuckin' 
          crew goin' for me, I'll tell you 
          that.

SAL FUSCO, JACK HARDY and BERNIE BLUE are getting out of a 
car and walking into the jewelry store which is designed to 
replicate an old-fashioned Western town with peaked roofs, 
wooden planked sidewalks and hitching posts. The camera tracks 
by each man as they're introduced.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story 
          guy. Jack Hardy, he worked for a 
          safe company after he did a six-year 
          bit. And then there was Bernie Blue. 
          This guy could bypass any alarm for 
          me. And I opened up my own jewelry 
          store, too: 'The Gold Rush'.

INT. BEDROOM OF LUXURY HOME - NIGHT

NICKY places some jewelry from a vanity table into a sack 
and turns over some family photos. MARINO and HARDY are 
struggling with a safe.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Sometimes I used to go along on a 
          heist just for the fun of it. But I 
          didn't like the people I was rippin' 
          off lookin' at me, so I used to turn 
          their fuckin' pictures around.

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO and HARDY)
          What's takin' so long over there?

                      MARINO
          This peter's a motherfucker.

                      HARDY
               (Grunting)
          It's workin'. Just keep workin' it. 
          It's comin'.

                      NICKY
          Gotta learn how to open these fuckin' 
          things so you won't have to take 
          'em.

INT. GOLD RUSH BACK ROOM - DAY

NICKY is looking at diamonds with MARINO, HARDY and BLUE.

                      NICKY
          Frankie, some of these stones got a 
          lot of niggers in 'em.

ZOOM IN TIGHT ON A DIAMOND.

                      NICKY
          Tell that fuckin' Pepe if he's 
          switching stones on us, he'd better 
          take a fuckin' camel -

Phone rings.

                      NICKY

EXT. WAREHOUSE/JEWELRY STORE - NIGHT

HARDY and a hood are in a van parked in front of a warehouse 
next door to a jewelry store.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...got a piece of the score.

               (From inside the van, 
               into a walkie-talkie)
          Car's comin'.

We move past the van to a larger truck parked in an alley. 
Unseen, the truck has an open side door abutting the jewelry 
store's wall. SAL FUSCO and BERNIE BLUE are inside the truck 
drilling into the wall using a heavy-duty battery-powered 
drill. The drill is muffled with sheets of insulation 
material.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They were always very careful. And 
          they always bypassed the alarms, or 
          else... if not, they'd drill enough 
          holes to knock through the walls 
          with a sledgehammer...

BLUE widens the hole with a hammer muffled with insulation.

EXT. JEWELRY STORE WALL - DAY

A flashbulb explodes.

Cops and detectives are photographing and inspecting holes 
drilled in the wall of the shop, through which the thieves 
have come and gone. The camera moves in through the hole.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Nobody out there was expecting a guy 
          like him.

INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

The stunned STORE OWNER looks at the rubble and the empty 
jewelry boxes.

Detectives collect evidence.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fuckin' 
          Wild West.

               (Leading a detective 
               to his showroom)
          I just got a shipment of diamonds 
          from Israel...

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But what the fuck they expect from 
          me? I had to earn, didn't I?

INT. PALM SPRINGS JEWELRY STORE - DAY

MARINO stands above two IRANIANS who are looking at the stolen 
gems.

                      IRANIAN #1
          You know, this diamond has flaws in 
          it.

                      MARINO
          No, no, there's no flaws in it.

                      IRANIAN #2
          Don't tell me. I'm doing this for 
          twenty-five years.

                      MARINO
          You better clean your fuckin' loupe. 
          'Cause there's no flaws in these 
          diamonds.

The two IRANIANS speak to each other in Farsi.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Whenever we got local merch, we'd 
          usually send it to Palm Spring or 
          Arizona... LA. I had a couple of 
          sand niggers out there. You know, 
          Arabs.

                      MARINO
          What, are you gonna have a fuckin' 
          meeting here, or are you gonna buy 
          some diamonds?

                      IRANIAN #2
               (Chuckling)
          No, no. I know his language. I'm 
          talking with him.

                      MARINO
          Forty thousand dollars, you can buy 
          the whole package.

                      IRANIAN #1
          Twenty thousand, and that's my final 
          offer and...

                      MARINO
               (To IRANIAN #2)
          All of a sudden he talks English, 
          now.
               (To IRANIAN #1.)
          Let's talk turkey here, how 'bout 
          twenty-five thousand?

IRANIAN #1 laughs.

INT. NICKY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

NICKY and MARINO sneak into the house past JENNIFER who is 
asleep on the sofa in front of a TV set. NICKY takes out a 
key and opens the metal door into his bedroom.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I actually turned my bedroom into a 
          bank vault where I kept the choice 
          stuff.

                      MARINO
               (Referring to JENNIFER 
               as they pass the 
               kitchen)
          She asleep?

                      NICKY
          Every night, on the couch.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush 
          in case we got raided by the cops... 
          or if my crew got cute.

Opening the metal door to his bedroom.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I had the only key.

INT. NICKY'S BEDROOM/CLOSET - NIGHT

Camera pans across bedroom to closet door.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Jennifer didn't give a fuck. She 
          used to fall asleep on the couch 
          watchin' television every night. 
          This stuff was all mine. I didn't 
          send any of this back home.

NICKY opens the closet door. He and MARINO walk in and bend 
down to lift up a small square of carpet to reveal a floor 
safe.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Actually, I couldn't because I wasn't 
          even supposed to be doin' it. The 
          bosses were makin' so much fuckin' 
          money with the casinos
               (unlocking the safe)
          that they didn't want anybody makin' 
          any waves for them.

In the floor safe, there are several handguns and silencers.

FRANK hands NICKY a roll of money.

                      NICKY
          Give all the guys in your crew a 
          piece of that?

                      MARINO
          I took care of everybody.

                      NICKY
          Yeah?  

He searches MARINO's jacket.  

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          That's why there was no real organized 
          street stuff in Vegas before I came 
          here.

NICKY throws the cash in the safe and closes the lid.

INT. NICKY'S HOUSE - DAY

NICKY is being shown papers by CHARLIE CLARK, a heavy-set 
banker with a moustache. They're both seated at a table in 
the living-room.

                      CHARLIE CLARK
          Yeah, that works out.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But how much cash could I bury in my 
          closet, right?

                      CHARLIE CLARK
          You need to understand, and I - I'm 
          sure you do... that in a venture of 
          this kind, you have to be prepared 
          to take some kind of loss.

                      NICKY
          Oh, listen, I understand that there's 
          always a risk... you know, I might 
          have to take a loss somewhere.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          So I put some of the money into 
          legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. 
          He was Ace's banker.

                      NICKY
          I mean, you will try to push it 
          through, won't you, Mr Clark?

                      CHARLIE CLARK
          Yes.

                      NICKY
          Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving 
          you fifty thousand cash.

CHARLIE CLARK chuckles

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Then I put some more of the money...

INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT, KITCHEN - NIGHT

A prosciutto sandwich is being prepared on a kitchen counter.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...in some legitimate places, like 
          my restaurant.

                      DOMINICK
               (To COOK preparing 
               sandwich)
          Is that the last one?

                      COOK
          Yeah.

He hands the sandwich to DOMINICK who spits in it.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I had my kid brother, Dominick, run 
          it for me.

                      DOMINICK
               (Spits)
          Fuckers!

DOMINICK wraps it in plastic and puts it into a brown paper 
bag.

INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT - NIGHT

DOMINICK sets the bag with the wrapped sandwich in it on top 
of pizza boxes being held by two uniformed Vegas COPS.

                      DOMINICK
          Here you go, guys.

                      COP #1
          All right. Thanks, a lot.

                      DOMINICK
          Yeah... yeah, enjoy.

                      COP #2
          Yeah.

He shakes COP #2's hand before heading back into the 
restaurant.

                      DOMINICK
          Have a good time.
               (Muttering to himself.)
          Choke on it, ya motherfucker!

                      MAN #1
               (Passing DOMINICK on 
               his way out)
          Hey, Dom.

                      DOMINICK
          Hey, how you doin'?

DOMINICK walks over to some patrons in the bar area. NICKY 
enters, kissing his brother.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He 
          was a real restaurant buff. And over 
          the years, he always made money with 
          them.

                      NICKY
               (Looking at one of 
               the patrons)
          Hey, Rich.

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS NICKY AROUND THE RESTAURANT PAST LAS VEGAS 
TYPES - DEALERS, LOUNGE ACTS, SHOWGIRLS, TV AND MOVIE 
CELEBRITIES, WAITRESSES AND BARMEN - WHO USE THE JAMMED PLACE 
AS THEIR HANGOUT.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          In Vegas, he had The Leaning Tower. 
          It was a very popular spot. He had 
          politicians, showgirls and movies 
          stars hangin' out all over the place.

NICKY walks up to STEVE ALLEN and JAYNE MEADOWS seated at a 
table, he whistles their theme tune as he approaches from 
behind.

                      NICKY
          Listen, that show over at the Flamingo 
          gets better and better.

                      STEVE ALLEN
          By the way, Sammy said whenever you 
          have a minute, give him a call.

                      NICKY
          Made a messenger out of you too, 
          huh?

                      STEVE ALLEN
               (Laughs)
          I'll do anything for a buck.

                      NICKY
          He does it. He does it to everybody. 
          Enjoy your dinner.

                      JAYNE MEADOWS
               (Chuckles)
          Thanks.

                      STEVE ALLEN
          Okay, thanks.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky 
          liked the most was the showgirls, 
          naturally. I mean, to them, Nicky 
          was the movie star.

NICKY walks across the room to MARINO and two showgirls, 
SHELLY and STACY.

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO)
          You walk past me?

                      MARINO
          Hey. This is Shelly.

                      NICKY
          Hey, Shelly.
               (Kisses her hand.)

                      SHELLY
          Hi.

                      NICKY
          How are you? Nice to meet you.

                      MARINO
               (Pointing to STACY)
          And this is Stacy.

                      NICKY
          Stacy.
               (Kisses her hand.)

                      MARINO
               (To the SHOWGIRLS)
          This is Nick.

                      NICKY
          Pleasure.

                      STACY
          Hi, Nick.

                      MARINO
          We're gonna have dinner. Come on.

                      NICKY
          All right, uh,
               (To SHELLY)
          Let's just check the kitchen first. 
          Excuse us one second. Come on, I'll 
          show you.

He takes SHELLY's hand and leads her out.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
               (From following scene)
          'Cause I fly stuff in fresh every 
          day.

INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT, PARKING LOT - NIGHT

NICKY and SHELLY walk across the parking lot and get into 
his two-tone, red and white car.

                      NICKY
          I get bread from back home. I get 
          fish from California. And you can 
          always tell a great kitchen like 
          ours because of the milk-fed veal. 
          That's the secret.

Opening the car door from the passenger's side, she gets in.

                      NICKY
          See, milk-fed veal is pure white. 
          Out here, they got that pink veal. 
          Slide over, honey.

She slides over, he gets into the passenger's seat and closes 
the door.

                      NICKY
          Now, pink veal, you can pound that 
          shit for two days and it'll never 
          get tender, you know what I mean?

SHELLY's head disappears into NICKY's lap.

INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT - NIGHT

FRANK and DOMINICK are at the bar watching as NICKY chastises 
AL, a gambler. The restaurant is empty except for a waiter 
milling around in the background, setting a few tables.

                      AL
          When I left here with the money...

                      NICKY
          Mm.

                      AL
          ...I got muscled on the street.

                      NICKY
          Mm.

                      AL
          A couple of guys, I owe them. So, 
          that's what I did. I gave 'em the 
          money.  That's what I did.

                      NICKY
          Yeah?

                      AL
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          You call yourself a man? You know 
          you're a lyin', low-life, 
          motherfuckin' gambling degenerate 
          prick? You know that's what you are?  
          Two small kids at home. I gave you 
          money to pay the fuckin' rent and 
          buy groceries, put the heat on. You 
          know your wife called Frankie and 
          told him the fuckin' heat's off?

AL glances over to MARINO.

                      NICKY
          Huh? And you didn't gamble that 
          fuckin' money? You're gonna stand 
          here and tell me that?

He shakes his head 'no'.

                      NICKY
          No, no? You didn't?

                      AL
          I didn't give 'em the m-

                      NICKY
          Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a 
          fuck out of me! You want to embarrass 
          me and make a fool out of me?!  You 
          didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled 
          the fuckin' money, I'll give you the 
          fuckin' money to put the fuckin' 
          heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!

The chastised gambler nods 'yes', bowing his head in shame.

                      NICKY
          Fuckin' degenerate, you.

NICKY takes some money from his coat pocket and starts 
counting out some bills.

                      NICKY
          Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.
               (Giving him the money.)
          Get the fuck out of here.

                      AL
          Thanks, Nick.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, thanks.

AL walks out.

                      NICKY
          Let me find out you fucked up, I'll 
          leave you wherever I find you.

INT. NICKY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

NICKY, worn out from the night before, is making pancakes 
for LITTLE NICKY.

                      NICKY
               (To LITTLE NICKY)
          How many of these you gonna eat, 
          huh?

                      LITTLE NICKY
          Two.

                      NICKY
          Two?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But around six-thirty in the morning 
          when he finished his day -

NICKY hugs and kisses his son.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          - no matter where he was or what he 
          was doing, he always went home to 
          make breakfast for his son, Nicky-
          Boy.

                      NICKY
               (Pouring some syrup 
               on his son's pancakes)
          Here, let's put a little of this on 
          for you. I know you like this. A 
          little butter, right, not a lot?

                      LITTLE NICKY
          Mm-hm.

                      NICKY
          You know why, right?

                      LITTLE NICKY
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          Why?

                      LITTLE NICKY
          'Cause it clogs up your heart.

                      NICKY
          What a smart kid you are!
               (Kisses him.)
          Okay, eat.

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, BACK HOME - DAY

MARINO walks through an office past a few hoods.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Every couple of weeks I used to send 
          Marino back to the bosses with a 
          piece of what I made.

TITLE IN: 'BACK HOME'

MARINO walks out of the office and through the garage.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Not a big piece, but fuck them, what 
          did they know? They were fifteen 
          hundred miles away...

EXT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, BACK HOME - DAY

Wide shot of gas station. There is snow on the ground. The 
cloudy, Midwestern skyline of warehouses and skyscrapers can 
be seen behind the gas station sign: 'All-American Gas'.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...and I don't know anybody who can 
          see that far. Their drop was a truck 
          stop/garage where...

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE - DAY

REMO GAGGI is seated in a chair as MARINO walks in. CURLY, 
one of Gaggi's men, and two of the bosses are there.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...Remo and the guys used to hang 
          out and count their millions.

                      MARINO
          Remo.

He bends down and kisses him.

                      GAGGI
          Hey, Frankie.

                      MARINO
          How are you?

                      GAGGI
          Fine, fine.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't 
          give a fuck. I mean, you know, they 
          all worked it out together.

                      MARINO
          Nicky sends his warmest regards.

MARINO unzips a small sack and hands GAGGI a thick stack of 
cash. GAGGI inspects it before handing it over to one of his 
men.

                      GAGGI
          Uh-huh. Good.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But I knew how to keep the bosses 
          happy. Whenever they gave me little 
          jobs to do, you know, to send a 
          message, I would carry things out...

                      GAGGI
          And how are things going down there?

                      MARINO
          Fine. Everything's goin' good.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...to a tee. Like the time Tony

Flash cut of TONY DOGS and two men shooting up a bar with 
automatics hitting the owner, bartenders and a waitress.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...who was supposed to be the new 
          maniac tough guy in town, shot up 
          one of Remo's bars. Here's a fuckin' 
          guy, kills two of Remo's guys and a 
          poor fuckin' waitress, who was just 
          workin' on her night off, of all 
          things.

SLOW MOTION ON TONY DOGS.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I mean, this guy's just beggin' to 
          be made an example of.

The men and the waitress lie dead on the floor. The bar is 
left in shambles.

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE - NIGHT

An enraged GAGGI gives MARINO orders.

                      GAGGI
          ...I want all the names of all the 
          other people he had with him. And I 
          don't care what you have to do to 
          him to get 'em. You understand?

                      MARINO
          I'll take care of it, Remo.

                      GAGGI
          E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 
          'Now, go!']

INT. SLOT-MACHINE SHOP, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

MARINO and BLUE are dragging TONY DOGS, who is beaten to a 
pulp, across the floor towards a workshop table. NICKY follows 
them.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          To be truthful with you, I had to 
          admire this fuckin' guy.  He was one 
          of the toughest Irishmen I ever met.

                      NICKY
          This fuckin' guy, he got some stamina, 
          don't he?

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          This son-of-a-bitch was tough.

                      NICKY
          Personally, I don't give a fuck who 
          was with him anyway. As long as he 
          gives me a name I could give to them.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          For two days and two fuckin' nights, 
          we beat the shit out of this guy. I 
          mean, we even stuck ice-picks in his 
          balls.

                      NICKY
          You better hope he gives me a fuckin' 
          name soon, or I'm gonna give him 
          yours, Frank.

MARINO and BLUE lay DOGS on the table and put his head in a 
vise. They're exhausted from beating him.

                      MARINO
               (To NICKY)
          Yeah, thanks a lot.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But he never talked.

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO)
          I know you would have ratted by now.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          In the end, I had to put his fuckin' 
          head in a vise.

                      NICKY
          Dogs. Dogs, can your hear me, Dogs?

DOGS gasps and mumbles.

                      NICKY
          Listen to me, Anthony. I got your 
          head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna 
          squash your fuckin' head like a 
          grapefruit if you don't give me a 
          name. Don't make me have to do this, 
          please. Come on. Don't make me be a 
          bad guy. Come on.

                      TONY DOGS
               (With what strength 
               he as left)
          Fuck you!

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO and BLUE)
          This motherfucker, do you believe 
          this? Two fuckin' days and nights!
               (To DOGS.)
          Fuck me?

NICKY begins to tighten the vise.

                      NICKY
          Fuck me, you motherfucker?
               (Turning the vise.)
          Fuck my mother? That's what you 
          fuckin' tell me?

NICKY angrily keeps spinning the vise handle until suddenly 
one of DOGS's eyes bulges out of the socket.

                      NICKY
          Huh? You motherfucker, you, huh?

MARINO and BLUE are horrified by the sight. Everybody freezes.

                      NICKY
          Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!

                      TONY DOGS

               of his mouth)
          Charlie M.

                      NICKY
               (Screaming)
          Charlie M? You make me pop your 
          fuckin' eye out of your head to 
          protect that piece of shit? Charlie 
          M? You dumb motherfucker!

                      TONY DOGS
               (Pleading)
          Kill me, you fuck, kill me.

                      NICKY
          Kill you,
               (unwinds the crank)
          You motherfucker you!
               (To MARINO.)
          Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The word got around that finally...

MARINO places a knife against DOGS's neck.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...there was a real gangster in town. 
          Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.

We hear DOGS gasp as the knife slices his throat.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - DAY

Extreme close-up of a slot-machine. Four reels with sevens 
across. Suddenly, the power goes out. Lights die down.. 
Machine 'waaaooows' down to a dead stop.

Security guards, on their hands and knees, are pulling the 
plugs on the three giant $15,000 progressive machines, as 
ACE talks to DON WARD.

                      ACE
          Four reels, sevens across, three 
          fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do 
          you have any idea what the odds are?

                      WARD
          Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, 
          maybe more.

                      ACE
          Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty 
          minutes? Why didn't you pull the 
          machines? Why didn't you call me?

                      WARD
          Well, it happened so quick. Three 
          guys won. I didn't have a chance to 
          call you.

                      ACE
          You didn't see the scam? You didn't 
          see what was goin' on?

                      WARD
          Well, there's no way to determine 
          that, Sam.

                      ACE
          Yes, there is. An infallible way! 
          They won!

                      WARD
          Well, it's a casino. People gotta 
          win sometimes.

                      ACE
          Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. 
          Now, you're insulting my intelligence. 
          What do you think, I'm a fuckin' 
          idiot? You know goddamn well somebody 
          had to get into those machines and 
          set those fuckin' reels.

SHERBERT enters, stands next to ACE.

          and get out of here.

          You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.

          I'll regret it even more if I keep 
          you on.

                      WARD
          This is not the way to treat people.

                      ACE
          Listen, if you didn't know you're 
          bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' 
          dumb to keep this job. If you did 
          know, you were in on it. Either way,

          Let's go.

ACE and SHERBERT walk off, WARD turns to leave.

          cowboy boots is a fuckin' county 
          commissioner or related to a county 
          commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of

                      GREEN
          This is his state. His uncle's Chief 
          Judge. His brother-in-law runs the 
          County Commission. I don't know how 
          many other relatives he's got in 
          town.  There's gotta be a way to 
          work him back in.

          Phil, I can understand. You're in 
          the finances, you're upstairs, but 
          you are not on the floor. I got 
          thousands of players. I got five 
          hundred dealers.  They're all lookin' 
          to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a 
          day. I have to let them know I'm 
          watching all the details, all the

          Look at that. Look at this. There's 
          nothin'... look how many blueberries 
          your muffin has and how many mine

          You know how long that's going to

          You're askin' me for twenty-five 
          thousand. I'm not out to make you 
          feel bad. I want to just be able to 
          trust you. You now, it's about trust. 
          I have to be able to trust you with 
          my life. Do you understand? Can I 
          trust you?
               (She doesn't answer.)
          Can I trust you?... Can I trust 
          you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?

                      GINGER
               (Quietly)
          You can trust me.

                      ACE
          Good, so then you could tell me what 
          the money is for.

GINGER gives him a look and leaves.

INT. VEGAS BANK VAULT - DAY

GINGER takes about two inches of $100 bills out of a safe 
deposit box and slips it in an envelope.

EXT. VEGAS/BANK/PUBLIC PHONE - DAY

NICKY is on a phone watching GINGER leave the bank.

                      NICKY
               (Into telephone)
          Yeah, she's leavin' the bank now. 
          All right, I'm gonna follow her.
               (He hangs up.)

INT. SALVADORAN DINER BOOTH - DAY

GINGER is in a booth with LESTER DIAMOND, handing him the 
envelope filled with money.

                      LESTER
          What does that mean? No, I know that 
          look. What does that mean?

                      GINGER
          It means I got the money.

                      LESTER
          You got money. That's a - That's a 
          good look.

SWISH PAN TO ACE ENTERING, FOLLOWED BY A HOOD. HE SITS DOWN 
AT THE BOOTH WITH LESTER AND GINGER.

                      ACE
          How you doin', Les? It's Lester, 
          right? Sam.

Extends his hand to LESTER, who shakes it.

                      ACE
          From my recollection, aren't you the 
          card shark... the golf hustler...  
          the pimp from Beverly Hills?

LESTER gives GINGER a 'how did you fuck this up?' Look.

                      ACE
          If I'm wrong, please correct me, 
          'cause I never knew you to be a heist 
          man.
               (LESTER sighs.)
          But if you are, you know what... 
          here, take mine too.

ACE takes some money out of his coat and puts the thick wad 
of bills on the table.

                      ACE
          Go ahead, take it. 'Cause you already 
          have hers.

LESTER turns and sees two HOODS standing by the front and 
back doors of the diner.

                      ACE
          She's my wife.
               (To LESTER.)
          Look at me. You did know that, didn't 
          you? You knew that she's my wife? 
          Huh? Hey, look at me.

                      LESTER
          Yeah, yeah. I know that.

                      ACE
          You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come 
          back again... ever... to take her 
          money... next time bring a pistol.  
          That way you got a chance. Be a man, 
          don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you 
          want to do me a favor? Get out of 
          here. I want to be alone with my 
          wife. Get the fuck up and get out of 
          here.

After stammering for a moment, LESTER gets up and begins to 
move towards the back door.  

                      LESTER
               (Quietly)
          Okay.

                      ACE
          You fuckin' piece of shit.

                      LESTER
          Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's 
          bullshit. You know, you know, what 
          the fuck?

The thugs follow him out of the back door. GINGER freezes.

                      ACE
          You remember when you called him 
          that night? When you said goodbye to 
          him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get 
          married, I'll be right down, we'll 
          get married.'  He didn't say that to 
          you, did he?

                      GINGER
               (Whispering)
          No, he didn't.

                      ACE
               (Picks up the money)
          Didn't. No, instead, what did he 
          say? 'Fuck him. Take him for 
          everything he's got.'

ACE takes GINGER by the arm to the rear of the diner where 
they can see the parking area through a glass door.

                      ACE
          Come here, I want to show you 
          somethin'.

EXT. REAR OF SALVADORAN DINER, PARKING LOT - DAY

Three HOODS rush LESTER who is running towards his car. GINGER 
bursts through the doors, trying to get to LESTER. ACE holds 
her back. They struggle. LESTER groans and gasps as the HOODS 
start to beat him up.

                      HOOD #1
          You fuckin' shit.

                      GINGER
          No! No! No! Don't!

ACE restrains her.

The HOODS punch LESTER in the face and stomach.

                      GINGER
          Make them stop it!
               (Sobbing.)
          No! No! No! It's not his fault! It's 
          my fault!

NICKY watches from a car in a parking lot across the street, 
out of GINGER's sight.

ACE forces GINGER into the car as the HOODS finish the 
beating.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          No! No!

The HOODS toss LESTER into his car.

                      LESTER
               (Falling into the 
               front seat on his 
               back.)
          Fuck!

NICKY watches as the HOODS walk away from LESTER's car.

                      LESTER
          Fuck you!

                      HOOD #2
          You piece of shit.

ACE pulls out of the parking lot with a wailing GINGER.

LESTER groans, trying to sit up.

                      LESTER
               (As ACE and GINGER 
               drive off down the 
               street)
          Couldn't do it yourself, you 
          chickenshit cocksucker!

INT. GOLD RUSH BACK ROOM - DAY

GINGER and NICKY are in the back room. NICKY is sitting on a 
couch while GINGER stands by a mirror with a curling iron.

                      GINGER
               (Throwing the iron on 
               the counter)
          He's such a prick. He had some guy 
          from the hotel beat him up. He didn't 
          want to do it himself. Oh, no, he 
          didn't want to get his own hands 
          dirty.

She takes a pill with a drink.

                      GINGER
          So, why'd he have to do that, huh?

She walks towards NICKY, who is sitting on a couch across 
the room.

                      GINGER
          Tell me.

                      NICKY
          I know it wasn't a nice thing to do 
          but -

                      GINGER
               (Interrupts)
          Yeah, no shit.

She sits down next to NICKY.

                      NICKY
          Well, you gotta understand it. He 
          doesn't know if this guy is shaking 
          you down or taking advantage of you.

                      GINGER
          No! No! I told him all about the guy 
          before we ever got married. This is 
          no fuckin' surprise.

                      NICKY
          Oh, you did? I didn't know that.

                      GINGER
          Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I 
          was trying to help, so... so what?

                      NICKY
          You know... the first time I ever 
          saw your guys together... I never 
          saw him so happy. I mean, I know 
          he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, 
          but...

She smiles.

                      NICKY
          I never see - You know, I never seen 
          him act like that with anybody else.  
          I think he's crazy about you. I mean, 
          he really loves you. He does.

                      GINGER
          Oh, come on. I went into this with 
          my eyes open, you know. I knew the 
          bottom could drop out at any time. 
          I'm a working girl, right?  You don't 
          think I'm gonna go into a situation 
          like this if I don't think I'm gonna 
          get covered on the back end.

                      NICKY
          Sure.

                      GINGER
          Am I right?

                      NICKY
          I can see that. Sure.

                      GINGER
          So, he put aside some jewelry for 
          me. A lot of jewelry.

                      NICKY
          You mean, like a lot of expensive 
          jewelry? About how much?

                      GINGER
          Mm, you want to steal it?
               (Cracking a smile.)

                      NICKY
          No. I - I'm just curious, you know. 
          I was wonderin' how much he would 
          put into a thing like that. That's 
          all.

                      GINGER
          I'm told it's worth about a million 
          dollars, maybe more. 
               (Sniffs.)

                      NICKY
          Well, there you go. But what does 
          that tell ya? A million dollars in 
          jewelry. Does that tell you the guy 
          is crazy about you, or what?

                      GINGER
          I should have never married him. 
          He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini...  
          duality.
               (Breaking down.)
          Gemini's the snake. You know you 
          can't trust the snake.
               (Sniffs.)
          I mean it.

                      NICKY
          I know what you mean.

He moves closer to her.

                      NICKY
          Listen, Ginger... you know, this is 
          probably not... I don't have the 
          answers anyway... and this is probably 
          not what you want to hear right now, 
          because you're a little upset with 
          Ace.

                      GINGER
          I do.

                      NICKY
          I understand that. But, you know, I 
          think you should try to make the 
          best of it now. Go slow, you know. 
          See what happens.

                      GINGER
          He could have killed him! Okay? He 
          could have killed him. 

She gets up and walks to the counter by the mirror.

                      GINGER
          He didn't have to hit him. It's not 
          exactly like I'm sleepin' with the 
          guy! And he makes me sneak around to 
          see my own friends! What the fuck is 
          that all about?

                      NICKY
          Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves 
          you so much. He's jealous and worried.

                      GINGER
               (Sighs, her voice 
               starts to crack)
          He gives a fuck what I do?

                      NICKY
               (Getting up)
          Look, I'll try to find out what the 
          hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll 
          talk to him.

                      GINGER
          Okay.

                      NICKY
          All right?

                      GINGER
          Yeah.
               (Walking over to him, 
               smiling.)
          Thanks.

Towering over NICKY, holding a drink in one hand and his 
shoulder in the other, she leans down and kisses him.

                      GINGER
          Thanks for puttin' up with me.

NICKY takes the drink out of her hand.

                      NICKY
          And take it easy with this shit, 
          will you? I mean, this can only make 
          matters worse.

                      GINGER
          Oh, come on.

                      NICKY
          You're a beautiful girl. You don't 
          want to ruin your looks. I've seen a 
          lot of girls get shot to hell from 
          this stuff.

                      GINGER
               (Fidgeting with his 
               jacket, then holding 
               his face in her hands, 
               smiling.)
          You're so nice.
               (She begins to cry.)

                      NICKY
          Come on, now, I don't want to see 
          you unhappy.

She kisses him.

                      GINGER
               (Tenderly strokes his 
               head)
          Thanks.

                      NICKY
          Yeah.

She embraces NICKY, wrapping her arms around him.

                      GINGER
               (Through tears)
          Thank you.

                      NICKY
               (Feeling a little 
               awkward with the hug)
          It's all right.

She kisses him again. NICKY doesn't move, holding back.

INT. ACE'S OFFICE - DAY

Pull back from a sign, with a tiny 'yes' on top of a gigantic 
'no', leaning on a window overlooking the sportsbook. We see 
ACE, behind his desk, taking a swig of Mylanta. His SECRETARY 
telephones.

INT. ACE'S OUTER OFFICE, SECRETARY'S DESK - DAY

We see past PAT WEBB's cowboy hat down onto Ace's SECRETARY 
on the phone.

                      SECRETARY
               (Into telephone)
          Mr Rothstein? County Commissioner 
          Pat Webb is here to see you.

                      ACE
               (Over telephone)
          Okay...

INT. ACE'S OFFICE - DAY

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          ...give me a minute.

                      SECRETARY
               (Over telephone)
          Okay.

ACE hangs up the phone.

INT. ACE'S OUTER OFFICE, SECRETARY'S DESK - DAY

                      SECRETARY
               (To WEBB)
          It'll just be a minute.

INT. ACE'S OFFICE - DAY

ACE gets up from his desk and we see he is in his boxer 
shorts. He opens the closet and carefully puts on the trousers 
hanging inside.

INT. ACE'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

A very patient WEBB is leaning against some double doors 
across from Ace's SECRETARY.

                      SECRETARY
          Mr Webb...  Can I get you anything?

                      WEBB
          Oh, no.
               (Cordially tipping 
               his hat.)
          No, thank you, little lady.

INT. ACE'S OFFICE - DAY

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Okay, send him in and call me four 
          minutes after.

WEBB walks in. He is big, tough and western, wearing a 
Stetson, tooled boots, jeans, an elbow-patched jacket and a 
turquoise bear claw string-tie. His headband contains a 
rattlesnake head. Ace's SECRETARY shuts the door on her way 
out.

                      WEBB
          Mr Rothstein...
               (With hand outstretched 
               to ACE.)
          I'm Pat Webb.

                      ACE
          How do you do?

They shake hands.

          Hey, it is my pleasure.

                      ACE
          Yeah, I heard a lot about you.

                      WEBB
          Oh, thank you, sir.

          Hey, house is doin' well.
               (Chuckling.)
          Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I 
          appreciate you takin' the time to 
          see a poor ol' civil servant.

                      ACE
          No, that's quite all right.

TILT UP FROM WEBB'S SNAKESKIN COWBOY BOOTS AND ACE'S BLUE

                      ACE
          Why don't you have a seat?

                      WEBB
          Hm? Oh. Thank you, sir.

WEBB sits down in a chair in front of ACE's desk.

                      WEBB
          Uh, I come here personally to kind 
          of smooth over a fracas about a 
          certain matter. See, uh, maybe you 
          didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is 
          a very well-liked man in this town.  
          He's got lots of friends here. Now, 
          his family and their money go back 
          many, many years. Now, friends vote... 
          family and money votes. That's 
          important to me... and you. And if 
          you'll think about our little problem 
          along them lines...  and you forgive 
          me for sayin' it, maybe he did not 
          deserve to be fired.

                      ACE
          I'm sorry, but he knew about our 
          gettin' hit on three big machines in 
          a row and he did nothing about it.  
          That means either he was in on it 
          or, forgive me for saying this, he 
          was too dumb to see what was going 
          on. Either way, I cannot have a man 
          like that workin' here.

                      WEBB
          Before we point the dirty end of the 
          stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be 
          sure we can prove them charges.

                      ACE
          Believe me, if I could prove it, he 
          would be under arrest.

                      WEBB
          Are, uh -
               (Clears throat.)
          - are we certain that you want the 
          Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your 
          record and your gangster pals like 
          Nicky Santoro?

                      ACE
          I think you're way out of line talkin' 
          to me like that. What you're sayin' 
          is libelous, and you're in no position 
          to challenge my expertise. I went 
          way out of my way to be very helpful 
          and courteous to that kid. He's weak, 
          he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the 
          whole place. There's not much more I 
          can do for him.

                      WEBB
               (Chuckling)
          You have got me there. Old Don is as 
          useless as tits on a boar.
               (Chuckles.)
          But, he is my brother-in-law, and I 
          would look on it as a personal favor 
          if you'd think some more on hirin' 
          him back.

                      ACE
          I can't do that. And I appreciate 
          the fact that he's your brother-in-
          law, and I do want to help you and I 
          like to do favors, and I know who 
          you are, but I cannot do that.

                      WEBB
          Well, could there be any position... 
          further down the trough?

                      ACE
               (Pause)
          I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's 
          too incompetent. And the bottom line 
          is, he cannot be trusted.

          Okay, thanks.
               (To WEBB.)
          Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.

                      WEBB
          Mr Rothstein. Your people never will 
          understand the way it works out here. 
          You're all just our guests. But you 
          act like you're at home. Let me tell 
          you somethin', partner... you ain't 
          home. But that's where we're gonna 
          send you if it harelips the Governor.

          Thank you for your time.

                      ACE
          No problem.
               (Getting up and shaking 
               hands.)
          Sorry.

          You bet.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM/BEDROOM - DAY

ACE, in pain from his ulcer, opens a bottle of pills in his 
bathroom and sees that it is almost empty.

                      ACE
          What happened to my pills?

He leaves the bathroom and walks into the bedroom where GINGER 
is stretched out on their imperial bed.

                      GINGER
          Huh?

                      ACE
               (Waving the pill bottle)
          Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' 
          too much, you're takin' all my pills 
          too?

                      GINGER
          I didn't take your pills.

                      ACE
          Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a 
          one of these, a half a one of these.  
          And that's when I have extreme pain. 
          I had a three-month supply. What'd 
          you do with 'em?

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          You didn't have to beat him up!

                      ACE
               (Walking back to the 
               bathroom)
          What?

ACE puts the bottle into the medicine cabinet.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          I was just tryin' to help him. It's 
          not like I'm sleeping with the guy!

                      ACE
          Yeah, how do I know?

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          You can't make me stop caring...

                      ACE
          What? What?!

                      GINGER
          I said, you can't make me stop caring 
          about people.

She starts to cry.

                      ACE

          Listen.

               bed.)
          Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best 
          of everything here, you know?  I 
          mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. 
          Uh, I mean... people look up to you 
          in this town. I don't know what to 
          think -

                      GINGER
               (Interrupts)
          You know what, Ace? I don't give a 
          shit! I'm gettin' out of here.
               (Crying.)
          I am.

She sits up woozy, and tries to pull on her trousers.

               bed to her)
          It's okay.  Look...

               gently)
          ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.

                      GINGER
          Okay.

                      ACE
          If not for me, at least for Amy.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          Okay, okay.

                      ACE
               (Gently)
          You understand? Your drinking's 
          gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna 
          get you into a program. They got 
          plenty of good ones.

                      GINGER
          I don't need one.

                      ACE
          Yes, you do. It's very discreet. 
          There's no names in the papers. You 
          don't have to worry about any of 
          that stuff.

                      GINGER
          That's all you care about.
               (Collapsing on the 
               edge of the bed.)
          You don't care about me at all.

                      ACE
               (Bending down to her)
          Yes, I - yes, I do.

                      GINGER
          No, you don't.

                      ACE
          How could you say that?  You're a 
          beautiful woman. You're destroying 
          yourself. You don't need that stuff. 
          You don't need that fuckin' leech 
          livin' off you. I know you better 
          than you know yourself. You're a 
          tiger, you're stronger than I am.  
          And when you set your mind on doing 
          something, you do it better than 
          anybody.
               (Strokes her hair. 
               Then, quietly:)
          You can do it.
               (Kissing her.)
          You can do it.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... 
          I'll try. I'll try.

She sits up and puts her arms around ACE's waist. He strokes 
her head.

                      GINGER
          I'll try. I will. Don't be mad at 
          me, okay... I will.

          'Wait'] Wait a minute. You mean to 
          tell me that the money we're robbing 
          is bein' robbed? That somebody's

a bucket of coins and dumping them into a trough. A clerk, 
seated at a coin weighing scale, places a ticket into a small

          Even John Nance, that's the guy who 
          ran the skim, he knew there wasn't 
          much you could do about it. You gotta 
          know that a guy who helps you steal, 
          even if you take care of him real 
          well, I mean, he's gonna steal a 
          little bit extra for himself. Makes 
          sense, don't it? Right? Well, you go

          You know, they take this money because 
          they're my guys. So you gotta give

          What the hell have you been doin' 
          out there?

                      PISCANO
          I was out there with my cumma [Italian-
          American slang for 'girlfriend'.]

          your cumma?

                      PISCANO
          What else? I gave her a schaff 
          [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          The only trouble was, Piscano was a 
          disaster. This guy could fuck up a 
          cup of coffee.

          And little did anybody know where 
          this would all lead. If they did, 
          they would have been better off makin' 
          fuckin' novenas.

          paid my expenses for the last trip.

INT. TANGIERS, GREEN'S OFFICE - DAY

GREEN is arguing with ANNA SCOTT, a fifty-year-old no-nonsense 
businesswoman.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...was gonna stop what came up next 
          at the casino.

                      GREEN
          I can't believe you're doing this.

                      SCOTT
          We made a deal. You came to me, 
          remember?

                      GREEN
          Yes, I appreciated your advice...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          It turned out Phil Green, Mr 
          Integrity, had a partner nobody knew 
          about... and when she showed up and 
          started demanding some money from 
          the Tangiers...

                      GREEN
          Why are you doing this to me?

                      SCOTT
          Because you're wrong.

                      GREEN
          I'm not wrong.

                      SCOTT
          Yes, you are.

                      GREEN
          No, I am not wrong.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...Green tried to stonewall her.

                      SCOTT
          And you're not going to get away 
          with this! I will see to it that you 
          do not get away with this!

She walks out.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          So...

INT. COURT-ROOM - DAY

A JUDGE is seated at his bench. SCOTT and GREEN, surrounded 
by their lawyers, take their seats. NANCE watches from the 
back row.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...she sued him in court.

                      JUDGE
          The court will now hear the matter 
          of the plaintiff, Anna Scott, against 
          Tangiers Corporation and its 
          president, Philip Green.

                      LAWYER #1
          Good morning, your Honor. John Momet

          Mr Logan, you may proceed.

                      LAWYER #2
          Thank you, Judge.

As the JUDGE pounds his gavel, we see ANNA SCOTT and a grim 
GREEN.

INT. COURT-HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

ANNA SCOTT holds an impromptu press conference.

                      SCOTT
          I believe he was absolutely fair and 
          I'm delighted with the decision.

NANCE is talking at a pay phone, SCOTT and the reporters are 
in the background.

CURLY hands GAGGI the phone. He listens.

               (Over telephone)
          It didn't go too well.

               him, exiting the 
               court-house)
          Green has to open up the books... 
          has to show how he got the financing. 
          And, hey, that's - that's not good.

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE, BACK 
HOME - DAY

GAGGI, holding a cigarette, snaps his fingers in disgust, 
grunts, and slams down the phone. He men watch in silence.

                      GAGGI
          Shit.

CURLY takes the phone away.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          She was doin' pretty good with her 
          lawsuit, but before she could start 
          countin' her money, the boys back 
          home decided to settle the case out 
          of court instead.

INT. ANNA SCOTT'S HOME, KITCHEN, LAS VEGAS - DAY

SCOTT, alone, is sitting at her kitchen table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          So, they send me.

NICKY swiftly enters the room, grabs SCOTT around the neck, 
and fires three shots into her head.

He leans SCOTT back against the chair, then gently, while 
stroking her hair, sets her head to the side. Blood flows 
from her mouth on to her pink robe.

NICKY grabs his gun and leaves.

Reporters are heard shouting 'Mr Green'.

EXT. LAS VEGAS PRIVATE AIRPORT - MORNING

GREEN gets off the Tangiers corporate jet and is assaulted 
by questions about the Scott murder. GREEN is stunned.

                      REPORTER #1
          Can you comment on the murder of 
          Anna Scott?

                      GREEN
          What are you talking about?

                      REPORTER #1 (O.S.)
          She was found last night, shot in 
          the head.

                      REPORTER #2 (O.S.)
          Was this just a real-estate 
          partnership?

                      REPORTER #3 (O.S.)
          Her lawyer said you were partners.

                      GREEN
          We were - We were involved in minor 
          real estate deals many years ago.  
          It was never a partnership.

Reporters chase CHASE as he walks down the ramp and across 
the tarmac to his white limousine.

                      REPORTER #1
          Police are calling this a mob-style 
          killing.

                      REPORTER #2
          Did you ever hear of the twenty-two-
          caliber killer?

                      GREEN
          I'm a little in shock, quite 
          frankly...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Now, instead of the cops only lookin' 
          at Nicky, they started looking at 
          Green too. And he was supposed to be

INT. ACE'S OFFICE - DAY

ACE is being interviewed by a female Business Week REPORTER. 
SHERBERT and RONNIE are sitting on a couch, listening to the 
interview. The REPORTER is seated across from ACE, at his 
desk.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...clean front man. So, I had to 
          start giving interviews to make sure 
          everybody knew the casino was on the 
          up and up.

                      REPORTER
          So, actually, how often do you really 
          fill in for him?

ACE looks at SHERBERT.

                      SHERBERT
               (to REPORTER, who 
               looks his way.)
          Green's here about two or three times 
          a month, and he's busy -
               (REPORTER glances 
               back at ACE.)
          - with other real-estate deals and - 
          and things, you know.

                      REPORTER
               (To ACE)
          So, in Green's absence, then, you're 
          the boss.

                      ACE
          I serve at the pleasure of the 
          chairman of the board and... my, uh, 
          responsibilities are to run the day-
          to-day operations.

                      REPORTER
          So, day-to-day, then, you're the 
          boss?

                      ACE
          Well, in a sense, you could say 
          that... I am the boss, when Mr Green 
          is away. You could say that.

INT. GAMING CONTROL BOARD OFFICE - DAY

A magazine headline reads 'Sam Rothstein: "I'm the Boss!" '.

                      WEBB (O.S.)
          Hm. Have you read this?

The magazine shows a photograph of ACE. A caption reads: 
'Rothstein asserts authority at Tangiers Casino'.

                      WEBB (O.S.)
          Hm? It's 'bout Mr Rothstein.

We see WEBB holding up a copy of Business Week in the gaming 
board office of investigators RONNIE DUPREY and MATT AUSTIN.

                      WEBB
          It says

          'The Midwest bookmaker with mob ties 
          says that he is the real boss of the 
          new hundred-million-dollar Tangiers 
          Casino empire.'
               (To DUPREY and AUSTIN)
          You believe that?

                      DUPREY
          Did he really say that?

                      WEBB
          Why, of course, he really said that. 
          It's right here. Has that man even 
          filed for his license yet?

                      AUSTIN
          I don't know. We'll have to check 
          the files.

                      WEBB
          Well, without gettin' your shorts in 
          a knot, would you do that? And kinda 
          check closely, 'cause we may have to 
          kick a kike's ass out of town.  Thank

          the wrong impression about me. I 
          think in all fairness, I should 
          explain to you what it is that I do. 
          For instance, tomorrow morning I'll 
          get up nice and early, take a walk 
          down over to the bank and walk in 
          and see you, and, uh... if you don't 
          have my money for me, I'll crack 
          your fuckin' head wide open in front 
          of everybody in the the bank. And 
          just about the time that I'm comin' 
          out of jail, hopefully, you'll be 
          comin' out of your coma. And guess 
          what?  I'll split your fuckin' head 
          open again. Because I'm fuckin' 
          stupid. I don't give a fuck about 
          jail.  That's my business. That's 
          what I do. And we know what you do, 
          don't we, Charlie? You fuck people 
          out of money and get away with it.

               in his briefcase)
          You can't talk to me like...

                      NICKY
               (Grabbing CHARLIE by 
               his jacket)
          Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my 
          fuckin' money to sleep. You go get 
          my money, or I'll put your fuckin' 
          brain to sleep.

                      CHARLIE CLARK
               (To ACE, panting)
          Sam?

                      NICKY
          Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is 
          personal.
               (Walking with CHARLIE 
               to the stairs.)
          I'll be there in the morning. You 
          can fuckin' try me, fatso.

A frightened CHARLIE hurries down the stairs.

                      NICKY
          You fuckin' try me.

He turns to ACE who's behind the bar.

                      NICKY
          You think he got the point?

          What're you doin'? He's a square 
          guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat 
          him like that. He's gonna run to the 
          FBI.

                      NICKY
          Fuck the FBI! That prick's been 
          dodging me for three weeks. And what 
          is it with you?  All of a sudden, 
          you're tryin' to tell me what to do 
          all the time.

                      ACE
          I'm not tryin' to tell you what to 
          do. But you were way out of line,

          Where's my head? Where's your fuckin'

          put somethin' really big together 
          out here. You know what I'm talkin' 
          about, huh? You know!  If you're 
          actin' like this now, how can I depend 
          on you?  There's a lot of things 
          gonna change out here. And if you 
          wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're 
          gonna have to go my fuckin' way.

                      ACE
          Listen, Nick, you gotta understand 
          my situation. I'm responsible for

          get that license.  And believe me, 
          if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go 
          bad for a lot of people, you 
          understand?

                      NICKY
          Yeah, forget about your fuckin'

          here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' 
          license.
               (Pause.)
          You know, I don't know what it is, 
          Sammy, but the more I talk to you, 
          the more I feel like you just don't 
          wanna go along with me, is that it?

                      ACE
          No, I don't wanna come -

          a trippa [Italian-American slang for 
          'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you 
          know, fried pigs guts? While, if I 
          wanna talk private, I gotta go to a 
          fuckin' bus stop.

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO)
          But, hey, what do they care, as long 
          as I keep sendin' money back.

                      MARINO
          Yeah, but they're complaining.

                      NICKY
          Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's 
          here.

The bus arrives, obscuring our view of them.

                      NICKY
          I do all the work. Somebody don't 
          like it, fuck him.

                      MARINO
          It's up to you.

                      NICKY
          They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.

When the bus departs it reveals NICKY and MARINO alone on 
the bench, talking.

                      NICKY
          I know one thing. All I gotta do is 
          take care of four or five of those 
          fuckin' guys, the rest will fall 
          right into place. Believe me.

INT. GOLD RUSH - DAY

NICKY is watching a police surveillance car with two agents 
through binoculars.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Peekaboo, you fucks, you.

                      NICKY
          I see you, you motherfuckers.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The problem was, Nicky was not only 
          bringin' heat on himself, but on me 
          too. The FBI watched every move he 
          made. But he didn't care. He just 
          didn't care.

THE CAMERA MOVES PAST NICKY TO REVEAL MARINO, SEATED IN FRONT 
OF TV SECURITY MONITORS ON THE PARKING AREA IN FRONT AND 
BEHIND THE GOLD RUSH.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          If they're gonna watch me, fuck 'em, 
          I'm gonna watch 'em right back. I 
          spent a few dollars. Top dollar, who 
          gives a shit?

HARDY, seated next to MARINO, is adjusting a knob on one of 
the may police radio scanners. There are a couple of cameras 
on the table next to him.

A debugging expert is going over the walls with a metal 
detector.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I got the latest anti-buggin' 
          equipment from the same places that 
          sell to the fuckin' CIA. I had all 
          the special police frequency radios, 
          FBI descramblers, cameras that see 
          in the dark, and because of that, 
          the miserable sons-of-bitches that 
          they are, they never once caught me 
          doin' anything I couldn't handle.

DOMINICK and FUSCO are at a table arguing.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I got my job...

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

NICKY swings a gold club. MARINO, and two men, are with him.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...on the line and this guy's out 
          havin' the time of his life. He has 
          every cop in the state watchin' him, 
          and he's out playin' golf.

                      NICKY
          Practice enough this week, you prick?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And at the...

EXT. ACE'S PATIO - DAY

ACE is with the Control Board investigators AUSTIN and DUPREY. 
They are all pouring over legal files and record books out 
on a table by the swimming pool.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...worst possible time for me.

                      AUSTIN
          A record of the arrests...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I had my license hearing coming up 
          and I didn't wanna leave anything to 
          chance.

                      ACE
          That was nineteen years ago, and 
          they were simple gambling pinches.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, 
          where am I gonna go?

                      AUSTIN
          You've been very open with us. I 
          mean, uh, your books and papers and...  
          that - that's gonna mean something 
          when you go before the Commission.

                      ACE
          Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a 
          fair hearing.

                      DUPREY
          Well, this kind of honesty will 
          guarantee that fair hearing.

                      ACE
          Good.

                      AUSTIN
          All right, well, we'll move on to -

Suddenly a sputtering airplane flies right over Ace's house.

                      AUSTIN (O.S.)
               (As he looks at the 
               plane)
          I wanted to hear something about...  
          Kansas City.

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

                      NICKY
               (Looking at the 
               airplane)
          What the fuck is this? Where's this 
          fuckin' guy gonna land, on the 
          fairway?

EXT. ACE'S PATIO - DAY

ACE and the board investigators follow the plane as it lands 
on the fairway. ACE has taken off his sunglasses to get a 
better look. Two men in suits get out.

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO)
          They're fuckin' agents, Frankie. 
          Look at this.

EXT. ACE'S PATIO - DAY

The AGENTS run across the golf course, past ACE and the 
investigators, who look on open-mouthed.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The Feds were watchin' Nicky play 
          golf for so long, they ran out of 
          gas. Just what I needed. Right in 
          front on the Control Board.

The agents run behind the hedges by ACE's pool. AUSTIN and 
DUPREY stare at ACE as if he had something to do with it.

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

                      NICKY
          A hundred dollars, whoever hits the 
          plane.

NICKY, MARINO, and the other men swing their clubs.

EXT. ACE'S PATIO - DAY

EXT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...in comes Piscano, the Kansas City 
          underboss. He ran that little grocery 
          store in Kansas City where they 
          brought the suitcases.

INT. SAN MARINO GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY

PISCANO and his MOTHER are at the counter of his elderly 
BROTHER-IN-LAW's store.

                      PISCANO
          They're fightin' over those suitcases 
          again. You know what that means, 
          right? You know what that means, 
          right? That means I gotta take another 
          trip out to Vegas, and it's gonna 
          cost me another couple of grand.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He ran it with his brother-in-law, 
          but mostly what he did was complain, 
          complain about his trips to Vegas, 
          to his brother-in-law and to his 
          mother, all the time.

                      BROTHER-IN-LAW
               (Seated)
          You gotta lay down the law. Otherwise 
          they're gonna make a fool out of 
          you.

                      PISCANO
          They're not gonna make a fool out of 
          me. I write it all down in this book,
               (holding up a notepad)
          every fuckin' nickel that goes down. 
          Right here, receipts...

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
               (Chastising her son)
          Hey! Oh!

                      PISCANO
          Oh, sorry -

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          What's the matter with you?

                      PISCANO
          Receipts and bills and... everything's 
          here.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          Since when do you talk like that?

                      PISCANO
          I'm sorry.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          There's a lot of people here.

                      PISCANO
          Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell 
          him... screw around with those 
          suitcases and I'll take the eyes out 
          of his frickin' head.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          Again!

                      PISCANO
          I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' 
          head'.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          That's enough.

                      PISCANO
          I'm sorry.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And what happens next?

THE CAMERA TILTS UP TO THE CEILING AIR VENT TO A TINY 
MICROPHONE AND TRANSMITTER AT ITS BASE.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          You can't believe it. I mean, who 
          the hell would believe that the FBI 
          had a wire in the place lookin' for 
          some information about some old 
          homicide about some guy who was 
          whacked-out, God knows when, over 
          God knows what?

                      PISCANO
          Plus, what's to prevent him with the 
          suitcases, that he can take what he 
          wants?  Fuckin' Nance, he brings us 
          back two suitcases from the Tangiers, 
          and what about three or four?

          That's the law. You know, we can't 
          even go into the count room to watch 
          our money? Could you believe this 
          cowboy bullshit?

His MOTHER shakes her head.

                      PISCANO
          And sure he's got his people in there. 
          But how do you know? They could all 
          be in on it together, those miserable 
          fucks.

His MOTHER reacts to his language.

                      PISCANO
          I'll find out and, if it's Green 
          himself, I'll bury that bastard.

The Chairman is the SENATOR we saw earlier in the casino 
suite taking chips out of the bureau drawer. The room is jam-
packed: GREEN, GINGER, SHERBERT, as well as WEBB, reporters 
and other spectators. ACE's secretaries carry in legal papers. 
There are piles of briefs and law books on OSCAR's and ACE's 
table.

                      OSCAR
          Mr Chairman and members of the 
          Commission. Mr Rothstein is pleased 
          to be here today.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And when the day finally came, I was 
          ready. I felt so confident that all 
          I had to do was present my case.

                      OSCAR
          ...evidence... and we have documents, 
          one of which is a report by retired 
          FBI agents, which completely absolves
               (holding up a large 
               file folder)
          Mr Rothstein from any wrongdoing. 
          I'd like this marked, please, Mr 
          Chairman.

                      SENATOR
               (Into microphone)
          Pardon me, counselor. Before you 
          continue...

                      OSCAR
          No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -

                      SENATOR
               (Into microphone)
          ...this, uh, this Commission is 
          prepared to act on a motion denying 
          the Rothstein application.

                      OSCAR
          Denying?

                      SENATOR
               (Into microphone)
          Do I hear a motion seconded?

                      OSCAR

                      CONTROL BOARD MEMBER #1
               (Into microphone)
          Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.

                      SENATOR
               (Into microphone)
          Do I have a vote on the motion?

                      OSCAR
          Mr. Chairman -

The COMMISSIONERS quickly repeat:

                      CONTROL BOARD MEMBER #2
               (Into microphone)
          Aye.

                      CONTROL BOARD MEMBER #3

          Aye.

                      CONTROL BOARD MEMBER #4

          Aye.

                      SENATOR
               (Into microphone)
          The ayes have it. This hearing is 
          adjourned.

The CHAIRMAN bangs his gavel and prepares to leave. The 
COMMISSIONERS hurriedly pack up their papers. An enraged ACE 
rises and approaches the SENATOR.  TV CAMERAS ROLL.

                      ACE
               (Getting up)
          You guys have to be kidding.

The SENATOR picks up his briefcase.

                      ACE
          Adjourned! What do you mean, 
          adjourned?

                      OSCAR
          Mr. Chairman, please.

                      ACE
          Mr. Chairman...

The SENATOR picks up his folder.

                      ACE
          Senator, you promised me a hearing.

We see WEBB seated in the first row, watching.

                      ACE
          You won't allow me a hearing? You 
          didn't even look at the FBI reports.

A reporter holds a microphone up to the SENATOR.

                      ACE
          When you were my guest, Mr. Chairman, 
          Senator, at the Tangiers Hotel, did 
          you not promise me that I would have 
          a fair hearing -

The SENATOR bends down to a microphone.

               (Interrupting, into 
               microphone)
          I was never - I was never your guest 
          at the Tangiers.

               (Into microphone)
          That's right.

          I never comped you?! I don't comp 
          you at least two or three times a 
          month at the Tangiers?!

                      SENATOR
               (Into microphone)
          Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - 
          answer that at this time.

          Liar.

                      SENATOR
               (Into microphone)
          Mr Rothstein is being very typical 
          to this point.

                      ACE
          He's lying.

WEBB starts to leave.

          The only time I was at the Tangiers 
          was when I had dinner with Barney 
          Greenstein.

          Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -

                      SENATOR
          You were wandering around.

          building.

                      ACE
          I was in the building!

GREEN, embarrassed by ACE's behaviour, starts to get up.

                      ACE
          You know damn well I was at that 
          dinner, and you swore to me that I 
          would have a fair hearing at that 
          dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!
               (Pause, ACE looks at 
               OSCAR.)
          Well, tell me I was at least at the 
          dinner! A-allow me that much.
               (Pause.)
          Give me that much at least!

STONE is sitting across from GAGGI at his office.

                      STONE
          He's on all night, screamin' about 
          how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit 
          all the way to the Supreme Court. He 
          really must be crazy. He's gonna go 
          to Washington with this? 
               (Chuckles.)
          He's out of his fuckin' mind.

                      ACE (O.S.)

          It's a pity in this...

          ...state that we have such hypocrisy. 
          Some people can do whatever they 
          want. Other people have to pay through 
          the nose.

                      ACE (O.S.)
               (From previous scene)
          But such is life. 

                      GAGGI
          Andy, go see him. Tell him maybe 
          it's time he should quit.

EXT. MIGHTY MART CONVENIENCE STORE, REAR PARKING LOT, LAS 
VEGAS - NIGHT

SHERBERT and ACE pull up beside another parked car. ACE gets 
out of his car in a robe and pajamas and gets into STONE's 
car.

INT. STONE'S CAR - NIGHT

                      ACE
          First of all, what they did was 
          totally unconstitutional. We're 
          already on the list to be heard before 
          the Supreme Court of the United States 
          later this year.

                      STONE
          These guys back home don't give a 
          fuck about the Supreme Court and any 
          of this bullshit! They want things 
          to quiet down. They want you to walk 
          away from -

                      ACE
          Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. 
          How can I walk away? Don't you see 
          what's goin' on here? Don't you see 
          what's at stake?

                      STONE
          The old man said, 'Maybe your friend 
          should give in.'  And when the old 
          man says 'maybe', that's like a papal 
          bull. Not only should you quit, you 
          should run!

                      ACE
          Know what my problem is? Every time 
          they mention my name in the papers, 
          these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, 
          too. How the fuck does that help?  I 
          mean, the heat he brought down is 
          murder!  We had a police department 
          who was cooperative. He's pissed 
          them off so much now that nobody can 
          make a move anymore. I mean, what do 
          you do about that?

                      STONE
          What do you propose?

                      ACE
          I don't know, he doesn't listen to 
          me. Maybe he should...  get lost for 
          a while. Take a vacation. Would that 
          be so bad?

                      STONE
          They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.

                      ACE
          All right, look, if he took a break, 
          it would just give everybody some 
          time to maneuver. That's all I'm 
          saying. It's all that I'm saying.

                      STONE
          I would forget about the maneuver. I 
          would just get out.

                      ACE
               (Sighs)
          I can't do that.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Of course...

INT. NICKY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

JENNIFER is on the phone with GINGER; NICKY listens in.

                      JENNIFER
               (Into telephone)
          You know, I don't feel like playin' 
          tennis.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...as soon as Andy got back home, 
          Nicky heard about our talk in the 
          car.

                      JENNIFER
               (Into telephone)
          Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go 
          to the Riviera?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Next morning bright and early, I get 
          the call.

                      GINGER
               (Over telephone)
          One o'clock?

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - DAY

ACE listens in on GINGER's and JENNIFER's conversation.

                      JENNIFER
               (Over telephone)
          Great.

                      GINGER
               (Into telephone)
          You know, I've got to do some shopping 
          afterwards. Do you want to go?

INT. NICKY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

                      JENNIFER
               (Into telephone)
          Well, you know...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But just getting a call from Nicky 
          wasn't easy anymore. Even the codes 
          didn't work. So, we figured out 
          another act.

INT. FBI PHONE TAP ROOM - DAY

A bored FBI man, seated at his desk with a tape recorder and 
headphones, looks at his wrist watch.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          You see, if a phone's tapped, the 
          Feds can only listen in...

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...on the stuff involving crimes. So 
          on...

INT. NICKY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

                      ACE (V.O.)

          Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' 
          elbow.

The FBI man clicks off the tape recorder.

JENNIFER quickly hands the phone to her husband.

NICKY gives the phone back to JENNIFER.

ACE gives the phone to GINGER.

          Always asking questions.

He exits.

          Suzy Creamcheese has the exact...

INT. FBI PHONE TAP ROOM - DAY

The bored FBI agent clicks on again and hears GINGER and 
JENNIFER's inane conversation.

                      JENNIFER
               (Over telephone)
          ...same outfit.

                      GINGER
               (Chuckles, over 
               telephone)
          But I saw something...

                      GINGER
               (Into telephone)
          ...something very... cute.

ACE sits down on the couch behind her and lights a cigarette.

INT. FBI STAKEOUT POST, MOTEL ACROSS THE FROM THE GOLD RUSH - 
DAY

Through a windows of a motel room across the street from The 
Gold Rush, an FBI AGENT watches NICKY and MARINO exit the 
jewelry store, get into a parked car and rive away.

IRIS OUT.

                      FBI AGENT (O.S.)
               (Into a radio)
          Okay, he, uh, he's out. It's the 
          ant, uh, Brown unit. And he's with, 
          uh, bogie. I think it's Frankie.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Nicky started out before me because 
          it wasn't that easy...

SWISH PAN TO THE FBI AGENT LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW TALKING 
INTO A RADIO.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...for him to get around anymore.

                      FBI AGENT
               (Into radio)
          Okay, pulled out...

SWISH PAN TO NICKY AND MARINO DRIVING DOWN THE STREET.

                      FBI AGENT (O.S.)
               (Into radio)
          ...pretty fast. He's headed upstream.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Nicky couldn't even go for a ride 
          without changing...

SWISH PAN TO FBI CAR TRAILING BEHIND.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...cars at least six times before he 
          could shake all his tails.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE #1 - DAY

NICKY's car with MARINO driving pulls in; NICKY jumps out 
and gets in another car.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And because of all the planes, he 
          had to use underground garages.

MARINO drives off.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE #2 - DAY

NICKY's second car screeches in to another garage.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE #3 - DAY

NICKY hurries across the lot to another car.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE #4 - DAY

NICKY changes cars again.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE #5 - DAY

NICKY is running to yet another car. He drives off.

EXT. DESERT SCENE - DAY

A solitary ACE waiting in the vast desert, looking around. 
ACE looks at a sage brush and sand and a few rocks on the 
desert floor. This could be a hole meant for him. He steps 
away from it.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Meeting in the middle of the desert 
          always made me nervous.

It's a scary place. I knew about the holes in the desert, of 
course, and everywhere I looked, there could have been a 
hole.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

Aerial shot of NICKY driving.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Normally, my prospects of comin' 
          back alive from a meeting with Nicky 
          were ninety-nine out of a hundred.  
          But this time, when I heard him say, 
          'A couple a hundred yards down the 
          road', I gave myself fifty-fifty.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

ACE still standing in the desert. NICKY's car suddenly appears 
as a reflection in ACE's sunglasses, shaking ACE out of his 
desert-induced reverie. NICKY's car pulls up by ACE. He gets 
out and storms up to him.

                      NICKY
          Where the fuck you get off talkin' 
          to people about me behind my back?  
          Goin' over my head?

                      ACE
          What people?

                      NICKY
          What people! What'd you think, I 
          wasn't gonna find out?

                      ACE
          I don't even know what you're talkin' 
          about, Nick.

                      NICKY
          No? You said I'm bringin' heat on 
          you?! I gotta listen to people because 
          of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering 
          me out?! You better get your own 
          fuckin' army, pal!

                      ACE
          I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't 
          order you or anybody...  I only told 
          Andy Stone that you had a lot of 
          heat on you, and that was a problem.

                      NICKY
          You want me to get out of my own 
          fuckin' town?!

                      ACE
          Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit 
          blow over for a while so I can run 
          the casino. Anything goes wrong with 
          the casino, it's my ass. It's not 
          yours, it's my ass.

                      NICKY
          Oh, I don't know whether you know 
          this or not, but you only have your 
          fuckin' casino because I made that 
          possible!

                      ACE
          I -

                      NICKY
               (Interrupting)
          I'm what counts out here! Not your 
          fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' 
          TV shows! And what the fuck are you 
          doin' on TV anyhow?!

                      ACE
          What are you -

                      NICKY
               (Interrupting)
          You know I get calls from back home 
          every fuckin' day?!  They think you 
          went batshit!

                      ACE
          I'm only on TV because I gotta be 
          able to hang around the casino. You 
          understand that. You know that. Come 
          on.

                      NICKY
          Your fuckin' ass! You could have had 
          the food and beverage job without 
          goin' on television!  You wanted to 
          go on TV.

                      ACE
          Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That 
          way I have a forum. I can fight back.  
          I'm known. People see me. They know 
          they can't fuck around with me like 
          they could if I was an unknown. That's 
          right.

                      NICKY
          You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle 
          of yourself.

                      ACE
          Me?! I wouldn't even be in this 
          situation if it wasn't for you. You 
          brought down so much fuckin' heat on 
          me. I mean, every time I meet somebody 
          here, the big question is do I know 
          you.

                      NICKY
          Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your 
          fuckin' license on me, is that it?

                      ACE
          No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked 
          me if you could come out here, what 
          did I tell you? I mean, you asked 
          me, and I knew you were going to 
          come out no matter what I said, but 
          what did I tell you? Do you remember 
          what I told...

                      NICKY
               (Interrupting)
          Back -

                      ACE
          ...you? Do you remember what I told 
          you?

                      NICKY
          Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' 
          minute here. One minute. I asked 
          you?! When the fuck did I ever ask 
          you if I could come out here?! Get 
          this through your head, you -

                      ACE
               (Interrupting)
          You never - ?

                      NICKY
          Get this through your head, you Jew 
          motherfucker, you. You only exist 
          out here because of me!  That's the 
          only reason!  Without me, you, 
          personally, every fuckin' wiseguy 
          skell [Skell: the lowest form of 
          wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll 
          take a piece of your fuckin' Jew 
          ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're 
          fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over 
          my fuckin' head again! You 
          motherfucker, you!

NICKY drives off, leaving an angry and frustrated ACE to 
ponder the desert and the holes.

INT. JUBILATION NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Overhead of ACE, OSCAR, SHERBERT, TRUDY and showgirls walking 
down the zebra pattern carpet of the nightclub. They are 
escorted to their table.

NICKY, MARINO and DOMINICK are seated at another table in 
the rear of the club so no one can hear their conversation.

                      MARINO
          Well, we got company.

ACE avoids looking at NICKY.

                      NICKY
          Do you see that? Dumb Jew 
          motherfucker. Grew up together and 
          he's actin' like he don't even know 
          me. I know we're supposed to avoid 
          each other, but, you know, there's 
          ways to do things and there's ways 
          not to.

                      DOMINICK
          Yeah. Fuck him.

SHERBERT and the others make a toast.

                      SHERBERT

                      SHERBERT
          Here we go. Good luck.

NICKY watches ACE's entourage.

                      DOMINICK
          Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it 
          bother you.

                      NICKY
          Why, does it look like it's bothering 
          me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' 
          Oscar too. All the fuckin' money 
          I've given that prick, he don't even 
          look over here. What's his problem?

                      MARINO
          Mm.

                      NICKY
          Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't 
          they?

                      MARINO
          They're havin' a good time too.

                      NICKY
          So are we.

NICKY, MARINO and DOMINICK are isolated and alone at their 
table.

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ACE sleeping. A hot line to the casino rings as a red light 
blinks.

          Yeah?

INT. TANGIERS CASINO SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT

SHERBERT is calling ACE.

                      SHERBERT
               (Quietly into telephone)
          Sam, we got a problem.

          What is it?

                      SHERBERT
               (Over telephone)
          The little guy. He's half in the

INT. TANGIERS BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT

NICKY is betting every spot on the blackjack table. MARINO 
is standing behind him. The DEALER is nervous.

                      SHERBERT
          ...nose wide open. He took the money 
          out of his own kick. His nose is 
          open for about ten thousand.

SHERBERT and the pit boss look on.

                      SHERBERT (O.S.)
          Now, he's really pissed.

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Oh, no.

Sits up and throws off the bed covers.

INT. TANGIERS SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT

                      SHERBERT
               (Into telephone)
          He wants a fifty-thousand marker.

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          No, just - just give him, give him 
          ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right 
          down.

INT. TANGIERS BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT

                      SHERBERT
               (To NICKY)
          He's gonna come up with ten thousand, 
          just the way you wanted.

                      NICKY
          Ten thou? No, no, no.

                      SHERBERT
          ...give you ten thousand -

                      NICKY
               (Grabbing SHERBERT's 
               lapel)
          Fifty! I said fifty!

                      SHERBERT
          Look, take -

                      NICKY
               (Pushing him away and 
               walking back to the 
               blackjack table)
          Fuckin' fifty thousand!  Go get it. 
          I don't give a fuck where you get 
          it.
               (To FEMALE DEALER.)
          Fuckers!  They take it, but they 
          don't want to give it back.

NICKY turns up another bad card and looks at the dealer. She 
smiles as she slides the house winnings over to her side of 
the table.

                      NICKY
          How the fuck can you grin? How the 
          fuck could you grin?

The FEMALE DEALER looks to her PIT BOSS for help. He steps 
up to a MALE DEALER at a neighboring table.

                      NICKY
          You know how much I'm stuck? You 
          give a fuck?

The MALE DEALER walks up to the FEMALE DEALER and taps her 
on the shoulder.

                      NICKY
          Do ya?!

She lays down some cards, claps her hands to show the Eye-in-
the-Sky that they are empty, and exits.

                      NICKY
               (To departing FEMALE 
               DEALER)
          Yeah. Give yourself a hand right 
          across your fuckin' mouth.

The MALE DEALER takes her place behind the table.

                      NICKY
          Look at this fuckin' beaut they put 
          in now. Sherbert send you in here to 
          rob me now? Been fuckin' knockin' 
          everybody's dick in all night? Huh?  
          You been beatin' all the customers 
          tonight, motherfucker?

We see the PIT BOSS lock up the chip tray from the table the 
dealer has just left. NICKY has a diminished stack of chips 
and an upturned ten and a two.

                      NICKY
          Huh, jag-off? Hit me.

The card is a king or a 'paint', a picture card, meaning 
that NICKY has lost.

Everyone freezes in fear. NICKY takes the paint and flicks 
it at the DEALER's chest where it sticks to his shirt.)

                      NICKY
          Take this stiff and pound it up your 
          fuckin' ass! Hit me again.

The DEALER looks to the PIT BOSS who nods 'okay'. He turns 
over a card. It's another paint, a queen. NICKY flicks the 
card to the DEALER's face.

                      NICKY
          Take this one and stick it up your 
          sister's ass! Hit me again.

The DEALER looks to the PIT BOSS again.

                      NICKY
          That's it, keep lookin' at him, you 
          fuckin' dummy. If you had any fuckin' 
          heart at all, you'd be out fuckin' 
          stealin' for a livin'.
               (Tossing the card at 
               the DEALER.)
          Hit me again.

The DEALER looks at the PIT BOSS.

                      NICKY
          What the fuck you keep lookin' at 
          him for, huh, you fuckin' pu-

The DEALER deals him another paint.

                      NICKY
          Look at this, twenty fuckin' paints 
          in a row. Hit me again!

ACE enters the casino with SHERBERT.

                      MARINO
               (To NICKY)
          He's here.

                      NICKY
               (To the DEALER)
          You should pay as fast as you collect, 
          you know.

NICKY gets up to go over to ACE, glowering at SHERBERT as he 
walks past.

ACE and NICKY are partially hidden behind a pillar by the 
slot-machines.

                      ACE
          What are you doin'? You gotta get 
          out of here!

                      NICKY
          Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker 
          over here to pay that marker.

                      ACE
          Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' 
          to me. I'm here to help you. What's 
          the matter with you?  You're gonna 
          bury us both.

                      NICKY
          Just give me the money. Fuckin' give 
          me the fuckin' money, Sammy.

                      ACE
          I'm gonna okay you ten and get you 
          even, and that's it. Then you got to 
          get out of here before the cops and 
          the newspapers are all over you.

To the PIT BOSS, holding up ten fingers.

                      ACE
          Ten and that's it.

He makes a throat cutting gesture with his hand. ACE leaves. 
NICKY turns to walk back to the table. He sees SHERBERT 
standing right behind him.

                      NICKY
          What are you starin' at, you bald-
          headed Jew prick?!

Before SHERBERT can answer, NICKY grabs the receiver off a 
wall phone and hits him across the face and back. SHERBERT 
falls to the floor. NICKY pulls the cradle off the pillar 
and tosses it down on his back. He and MARINO walk back to 
the table, SHERBERT winces on the floor in shock.

                      NICKY
          Sue me, you Jew fuck!

                      MARINO
          Let's get out of here.

                      NICKY
          What? Get out of here? I got a marker 
          comin'.

He puts some chips down on the table.

                      NICKY
               (To DEALER)
          Deal.

INT. OSCAR, THE LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY

ACE and GINGER are seated across from OSCAR, their lawyer.

                      OSCAR
          I know, but everything's changed 
          now. You're talking about a divorce.  
          You're even asking for alimony 
          payments and... child support... and 
          now custody.

                      GINGER
          I just want what any divorced woman 
          would get.

                      ACE
          I mean she's only sober about two 
          hours a day. It's usually from eleven 
          in the morning until one in the 
          afternoon. And if I gave her her 
          money and her jewels now, you know 
          what she's gonna do? She's gonna 
          piss it all away in about a year, 
          and then where will she be?
               (To GINGER.)
          Where would you be then? Comin' right 
          back to me, right back to me.
               (To OSCAR.)
          Or finding some other excuse to come 
          and I - I -

                      GINGER
               (To ACE)
          We had a deal. Remember that?
               (To OSCAR.)
          He said if it didn't work out between 
          us, that I could get my things and I 
          could leave.

                      ACE
               (To GINGER, leaning 
               closer to her)
          Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.

GINGER turns to him.

                      ACE
          You know me. Do you see anything in 
          these eyes that makes you think I 
          would ever let someone in your 
          condition take my child away from 
          me?
               (Pause.)
          Do you?  You know that won't happen.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And after all this time... and as 
          hard as I tried, as much as I 
          wanted...

INT. ACES HIGH BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR/SHOWGIRLS' DRESSING-ROOM - 
DAY

ACE, with Kleenex sticking out of his collar to protect his 
shirt from his television make-up, walks back to the dressing 
room with TRUDY. She pecks his cheek before exiting to her 
own room. A security guard opens the door for ACE.

We follow him past numerous showgirls and costumes.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...I could never reach her. I could 
          never make her love me. I always 
          felt she should have gone for all 
          that money... being somebody for the 
          first time in her life, a home and a 
          kid. But that's not what happened. 
          It just didn't work out that way.

                      ACE
               (To the showgirls)
          Everything all right?

                      ACE
          I mean, what could we do? After a 
          while, we'd just take breathers from 
          each other. You know, little 
          separations. At that time, I remember 
          Ginger took Amy and went to Beverly 
          Hills. She was gonna spend a week or 
          so shopping.

ACE picks up the phone at a make-up table.

engine to make it harder for anyone to listen in on their

          mean, this is family, it ain't 
          business. Meanwhile, you make calls 
          back home. Sammy, it makes us look 
          bad out here, you know what I mean?  
          Back and forth, this one and that

          She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.

          I think if you, uh, okay it, you 
          know, assure her that she's gonna be 
          all right, she'll come back.

          the kid back here. She wants to come

EXT. LAS VEGAS PRIVATE AIRPORT - NIGHT

ACE sees GINGER and AMY coming off the Tangiers private jet. 
GINGER wobbles a little as she comes down the ramp.

                      GINGER
               (Waving brightly)
          Hi, Sam.

ACE picks AMY up and hugs her, ignoring GINGER. They walk to 
the car and drive off.

INT. ACE'S CAR - NIGHT

AMY looks on from the back seat.

                      ACE
          So, what'd ya do with it?

                      GINGER
          With what?

                      ACE
          With the money.

                      GINGER
          He needed some clothes.

                      ACE
               (Sighs)
          Twenty-five thousand for clothes.

                      GINGER
          He wanted a watch, too.

                      ACE
          Twenty-five thousand for clothes and 
          a watch.

INT. VEGAS RESTAURANT - NIGHT

ACE and GINGER, dressed for dinner just like any other couple, 
walk towards a table overlooking the colorful lights of 
downtown Vegas.

                      MAITRE D'
          ...good evening. Signora.

                      GINGER
          Gino.

                      MAITRE D'
          This way.

                      ACE (V.O.)
               (as they are led to 
               their table)
          The good part was, I had Amy back. 
          So, we went home, had the housekeeper 
          stay over, put the kid to bed, I 
          calmed myself down and we went to 
          dinner. I tried to keep things nice 
          and civil, you know.  But... hey, 
          twenty-five thousand for three suits? 
          That doesn't make much sense.

                      ACE
               (Seated across from 
               GINGER at a booth)
          First of all, he's not gonna wear f- 
          thousand-dollar suits. But let's say 
          he did, which he won't. How you gonna 
          get fitted for twenty-five suits in 
          three days?  I, um, I mean, how could 
          you get fitted that fast? I can't 
          get fitted that fast, and I pay twice 
          as much.

                      GINGER
          I bought him a watch too.

                      ACE
          Yeah.

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          But even if you bought him a watch, 
          a really nice watch, one that he 
          thought was nice - and he doesn't 
          know what the fuck a good watch is - 
          so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          At the most, which is impossible for 
          him.

She glances to the table behind them.

                      ACE
          Plus, at the most, three suits, a 
          thousand apiece. That still leaves 
          what?  Around ten thousand?

                      GINGER
               (Staring down at her 
               plate, trying to 
               restrain herself)
          Would you knock it off, Sam?

                      ACE
          I'm just tryin' to figure it out.

                      GINGER
          There's nothin' to figure out. I'm 
          home... we're workin' it out.

She lights a cigarette.

                      ACE
          Yeah, but I've been told that before, 
          'We're workin' it out.' You think 
          that you're home... after what you 
          just put me through with Amy, is a 
          favor to me?

She looks at ACE.

                      ACE
               (Pause)
          So, counting the watch, let's say 
          another four thousand for expenses 
          over the weekend... of which you 
          must have had a good time. I know he 
          did.  That's for sure. I know that... 
          fuckin' piece of shit had a good 
          fuckin' time. On my money. You might 
          as well have fucked him, which you 
          probably did anyway.

GINGER glares at him.

                      ACE
          You're lookin' at me a certain way. 
          You - you're teary-eyed, huh? You're 
          upset. You're a good actress, you 
          know that?  Good fuckin' actress. 
          You can fuckin' get that pity out of 
          people. I'm not a john, you 
          understand?  You always thought I 
          was, but I'm not. And I'm not a 
          sucker. That fuckin' pimp cocksucker. 
          He's lucky I didn't kill him last 
          time. Lucky he's fuckin' livin'.  
          And if you would've stayed with Amy... 
          and you would've ran away... you 
          would've been fuckin' dead.

GINGER scoots out of the booth and leaves.

                      ACE
          Both of you. Dead. Dead.

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Wide overhead of ACE alone in bed. Off-screen, we hear GINGER, 
a little drunk, on the phone.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
               (Whispering into 
               telephone)
          I cannot do it anymore. I can't 
          fuckin' live like this. It's not 
          right.

ACE's point of view as he moves towards the sound of GINGER's 
voice. He enters frame and stops to listen.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
          What are you? Yes, of course - He 
          doesn't come home at night.  What is 
          the big fuckin' deal? I go - Yes, 
          and I just - I can't fuckin' take 
          it. Why should I fucking take it? 
          That wasn't the deal. He acts like...  
          like I'm the only one around here 
          with a fuckin' past. He'll never let 
          me live it down.  Well... well, I 
          mean, I tried. What the fuck do you 
          think I came back here for? No, I'm 
          not!

ACE slips into the foyer where he can see GINGER's reflection 
in a glass door as she talks on the phone in the living-room.

                      GINGER
               (Whispering into 
               telephone)
          I want to have him killed. Yes, I 
          want him killed.  I've fuckin' had 
          it.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - NIGHT

GINGER is on the phone.

                      GINGER
               (Into telephone)
          So, are you with me on this?

ACE steps up behind her. She gasps, still holding the phone.  
Petrified.

                      ACE
          You want to get rid of me? Here I 
          am. Go ahead, get rid of me
               (ACE grabs the phone.)
          Hello.

He hears nothing and throws the phone down near her.

GINGER rises and attacks ACE.

                      GINGER
               (Grunting)
          Yes! I fuckin' hate you! I can't 
          take it anymore!

ACE grapples with GINGER.

                      GINGER
          Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your 
          fuckin' guts!

                      ACE
          You hate my guts? I want you to come 
          with me now.

He drags her by her arms across the living-room hallway, 
into the bedroom.

                      GINGER
          Get off of me! Stop it!

                      ACE
          Come with me now! Come with me now. 
          Come with me now. I want you out of

GINGER screams.

          Let go of me! Let go of me!

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT

He pushes her against the closet wall, and throws an overnight 
bag at her.

                      ACE
          Take your
               (kicking the bag)
          fuckin' bag and get out of here!

                      GINGER
          I'll go, but I want my money right 
          now!

ACE tosses clothes at her.

                      ACE
          You'll get your money! Don't worry.

GINGER squats down and starts to gather her stuff.

                      GINGER
          The arrangement is over!

                      ACE
               (Tossing clothes)
          No kidding. NO KIDDING!

                      GINGER
          And I still get my money. I need 
          some cash right now. You can't just 
          put me in the street.

                      ACE
          I'll get your cash. You haven't been 
          straight with me ever since I met 
          you! You never loved me in the first 
          place!  I need eyes in the back of 
          my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' 
          bitch!

ACE walks past her to his side of the large walk-in closet. 
Racks and racks of her clothes are still hanging.

                      GINGER
          Love you?!

She tosses a pair of red shoes at him.

                      GINGER
          How could I love you?! How can I 
          love you?! You treat me like I'm 
          your fucking dog!

ACE leans down and opens a shoe box filled with money. He 
grabs as much cash as he can hold.

                      ACE
          You're lower than a dog!

                      GINGER
          Fuck you!

He walks up to her.

                      ACE
               (Shoving the bundles 
               of cash in her face)
          Here. Here. Is this enough money?! 
          Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' 
          days? Take it, greedy bitch.
               (Stuffing the money 
               in her bag.)
          Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' 
          want.

                      GINGER
          I'm going to the bank and I'm getting 
          my jewelry too!

She puts on a white fur coat.

                      ACE
          Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 
          9 a.m. Be there!

                      GINGER
          And don't send your guys down there 
          to stop me! I mean it.

She bends down to pick up her bag, but ACE insists on carrying 
it.

                      ACE
          I guarantee you, I will not stop 
          you.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM/FOYER - NIGHT

GINGER and ACE walk through their bedroom to the front door. 
He's carrying her suitcase.

                      GINGER
          Stop! You aren't getting rid of me 
          with one fuckin' suitcase!

                      ACE
          You'll come back tomorrow and get 
          the rest. Just get out of here.

                      GINGER
          Fine.
               (Sniffs, walking back.)
          I'm takin' Amy.

                      ACE
               (Stopping her)
          You're not takin' Amy.

                      GINGER
          I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.

                      ACE
          You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get 
          out of here.

He opens the door and tosses her suitcase out.

                      GINGER
          I am not! She's my daughter too! 
          Goddamn you!

                      ACE
          Get out of here!

He shoves her out the door.

                      ACE
          Send my lawyers a letter.
               (Slamming the door 
               behind her.)
          God-fuckin'-damn you!

He locks the door, and peers through the peep-hole.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
               (Through the doors as 
               ACE walks away)
          You're not getting away with this! 
          You're not gonna fuck me out of my 
          end!

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD - NIGHT

GINGER is furious. She picks up the suitcase and walks up to 
her sportscar.

                      GINGER
          Fucker!
               (Sobs.)

She drives off.

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT, LATER

ACE is lying awake in bed smoking a cigarette, watching the 
casino's Eye in the Sky surveillance monitors. He hears a 
car turn into his driveway. He sees the car's headlight beams

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The funny thing was, that after all 
          that... I didn't want her to go. She 
          was the mother of my kid. I loved 
          her. And later... I realized I didn't 
          want to give her the money, because 
          if I did... I knew I'd never see her 
          again.

ACE reaches over to take GINGER's hand - she slowly takes 
hold of his.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

GINGER is getting AMY ready for school. ACE enters as AMY is 
on her way out. He holds her face in his hands and kisses 
her.

                      ACE
               (Affectionately)
          Oh. Have a good day at school.

                      AMY
          Okay.

Amy exits.

                      ACE
          Okay? Okay, angel.

ACE walks over to GINGER who turns sullenly to look at him.

                      ACE
               (Clears throat.)
          From now on, I have to know where 
          you and Amy are at all times.

He takes a beeper out of his coat pocket and holds it up to 
GINGER.

                      ACE
               (Gently)
          Now, here's a beeper. I want you to 
          keep it on you. It's very light.  So 
          I can call you whenever I have to.

GINGER reluctantly takes the beeper.

                      ACE
               (Pause.)
          Okay?

She nods silently. He looks at her and turns, leaving her 
alone in the kitchen.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - EVENING

A very large trailer is in the middle of an empty construction 
site. GINGER's and NICKY's cars are parked outside.

                      NICKY (O.S.)
               (From trailer)
          Well, what are you supposed to do? I 
          mean, what do you want to do?  Do 
          you want to stay the way you are? 
          You want to stay like this?  You 
          can't do that.

INT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - EVENING

GINGER and NICKY are alone in the large trailer. They are 
sitting close together on a couch.

                      NICKY
          I mean, listen, two people don't get 
          along, at some point you gotta call 
          it... I mean, it's none of my 
          business, but I ... I think that's 
          what you gotta do. You gotta take it 
          somewhere -

                      GINGER
               (Smoking a cigarette)
          Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... 
          well, I was just -

                      NICKY
          What? What?

                      GINGER
          Nothin'.

                      NICKY
          What were you gonna say? Go ahead.

                      GINGER
          I don't -
               (Sighs.)

                      NICKY
          Tell me what you were gonna say. Go 
          ahead.

                      GINGER
          Yeah?

                      NICKY
          Yeah.

                      GINGER
          Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you 
          know somebody at the bank...  could 
          help me get my jewelry out?  There's 
          a lot of money in there. Lot of money 
          in there, and I'd be willing to take 
          care of anybody who helped me out.

                      NICKY
               (Pauses)
          Let me think about that.

                      GINGER
          Okay.

                      NICKY
          See who I got in there. Gotta get 
          somebody I can trust.

                      GINGER
          Mm-hm.

                      NICKY
          You know?

                      GINGER
          Yeah. 'Cause, you know,
               (leaning her head 
               back)
          He's never gonna give me my jewelry.

                      NICKY
          Hm.

                      GINGER
          He holds that key so tight, he's 
          probably got it stuck up his ass.

                      NICKY
               (Chuckles)
          Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's 
          probably got it there too.

Takes a sip of his drink.

                      GINGER
          He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have 
          buried him. I could have gone to 
          Europe and taken the baby. And then 
          he'd've tracked me down and he'd've 
          killed me.

                      NICKY
          No, he wouldn't. I would have.
               (GINGER chuckles.)
          And he'd've been right, too. I mean, 
          seriously.
               (She cuddles closer 
               to him.)
          Well, there's one thing you don't 
          do. You don't take a guy's kid and 
          then take off.

                      GINGER
               (Quietly)
          I didn't.
               (Chuckles.)
          I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I 
          did exactly what you told me to do, 
          and I came right back.

                      NICKY
          You did. You're right.

                      GINGER
          Exactly.

NICKY embraces her.

                      NICKY
          You did. I like that. I like that. 
          That's what I like about you. You 
          did the right thing.

                      GINGER
               (Playing with his 
               jacket)
          I did what you told me to.

                      NICKY
          Yes, you did.

                      GINGER
          'Cause you always tell me the right 
          thing to do.

                      NICKY
          Yeah.
               (Pause, with his arm 
               around her.)
          Boy, he really fucked himself up out 
          here -
               (She caresses his 
               face.)
          - didn't he?

                      GINGER
          Sure did.

                      NICKY
          Everything went to his head.
               (He sighs, rubbing 
               her neck.)

                      NICKY/GINGER
               (In unison)
          Changed.

                      NICKY
          He did. He ain't the same person, 
          right?

                      GINGER
               (Whispering)
          No, he's not.

                      NICKY
          He really thinks who the fuck he is, 
          I'll tell you that.

                      GINGER
               (Holding back tears)
          Exactly.
               (Sighs.)
          He hates me.

She rests her head on NICKY's shoulder, starting to weep.

                      GINGER
          He hates my fuckin' guts.

                      NICKY
          Come on, come on, you're a toughie. 
          You can take this.
               (Runs his hand down 
               her cheek.)
          Don't cry.

                      GINGER
               (Crying)
          I'm not as tough as you think I am.

                      NICKY
          Yes, you are.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          I'm not and he scares the shit out 
          of me. I never know what he's gonna 
          do.

                      NICKY
               (Whispering)
          Come on. Don't be scared.

                      GINGER
               (Softly, through tears)
          I need some help. I do. I need some 
          help.
               (Strokes his chest.)
          You gotta help me. I need a new 
          sponsor, Nicky.

GINGER's sobs subside a little and her hand starts to stroke 
NICKY's neck.

                      GINGER
               (Whispering)
          I do. I need a new sponsor.

                      NICKY
               (Quietly, cheek to 
               cheek)
          Is that what you want?

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          A sponsor.

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. 
          Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore.  
          I'll take care of ya.

                      GINGER
               (Whispering)
          Nicky, please...

                      NICKY
          Yes, I will. It's what you want, 
          isn't it? Huh?

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

                      NICKY
          It's what you want?

                      GINGER
          Yeah. Uh-huh -

NICKY interrupts and kisses her. She kisses him back. He 
pushes her head down to his lap.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - NIGHT

NICKY opens the door to the trailer and peers out to make 
sure no one is watching.

EXT. FBI SURVEILLANCE CAMPER - NIGHT

We see past a chain-link fence to a camper. We hear the sound 
of photos being taken with a high-speed camera.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - NIGHT

We see GINGER and NICKY slip out of the trailer in the 
deserted work site.

                      FBI AGENT #1 (O.S.)
          You see that?

EXT. FBI SURVEILLANCE CAMPER - NIGHT

FBI MEN with long-lens cameras are recording the event on 
film.

                      FBI AGENT #1
          That's Ace's wife.

INT. ACE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

ACE is waiting for GINGER. He hears a car pull into the drive-
way, he gets up and looks out the sliding glass door. It's 
GINGER. He sits back down, motionless with a glass of milk. 
She walks in with a sack of groceries and some dry cleaning.

                      GINGER
          Hi.

She puts her purse and the groceries down on the kitchen 
counter, and hangs up the dry cleaning.

                      ACE
          Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.

                      GINGER
          I threw it away.

                      ACE
          You threw it away?

                      GINGER
               (As she puts some 
               items away)
          Look, I tried to do this thing. I 
          know that you want me to, but it's 
          just - You know, I'm driving down 
          the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 
          'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm 
          in a restaurant and it's - it's 
          embarrassing. I don't want to do it 
          anymore.
               (Stopping suddenly.)
          Where's Amy?

                      ACE
          I put her to bed.

                      GINGER
          Oh.
               (Walking away towards 
               their bedroom.)
          I got your cigarettes.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - NIGHT

GINGER sets some items down on her dressing-table, in front 
of a mirror.

                      GINGER
          Oscar wants you to call him.

                      ACE
          So, who'd you go to lunch with?

                      GINGER
          With Jennifer.

                      ACE
          And where'd you go?

                      GINGER
          To the Riviera.

                      ACE
               (Pause)
          What'd you have?

                      GINGER
          I had a... salad.

                      ACE
          What did Jennifer have?

                      GINGER
               (Turning to ACE)
          She had the same.

                      ACE
               (Pause)
          Okay. I want you to call Jennifer 
          and I want you to tell her to tell 
          you what she had for lunch, and I'm 
          gonna listen in on the other line.

                      GINGER
          Why do you want to do that?

                      ACE
          You know why I want to do it. Just 
          do it.

                      GINGER
          Fine.
               (Walking out and down 
               the hall.)
          Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.

                      ACE
          Mm.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - NIGHT

GINGER is on the hall phone, dialing. We hear a phone ring 
through the earpiece.

She waits a few seconds and hangs up.

                      GINGER
          The line's busy. There's nobody there.

She starts to walk away. ACE stops her, picks up the phone 
and dials. We hear JENNIFER answer.

                      JENNIFER
               (Over telephone)
          Hello.

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -

TIGHT ON GINGER'S FINGERS CUTTING OFF THE CALL.

                      GINGER
          All right... I didn't have lunch 
          with Jennifer.

                      ACE
               (Hanging up)
          Who were you with?

                      GINGER
               (Quietly)
          I was with somebody.

                      ACE
          I know you were with somebody. Who 
          was it?
               (Pause.)
          I just hope it's not someone who I 
          think it might be.
               (Sighs, then whispers:)
          I just hope it's not them.

                      ACE (V.O.)
               (Quietly)
          I knew she fucked around.
               (Sighing.)
          You know...

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The two of them are seated separately. GINGER is on the floor 
leaning against a chair, crying softly.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...she did what she did and I did 
          what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky 
          was the worst thing she could've 
          done.

                      ACE
          What if he won't stop?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, it could get us both killed.

                      GINGER
          I can back him off.

ACE sighs.

INT. LA CONCHA MOTEL - DAY

GINGER and NICKY are making love on the bed, panting, grunting 
and gasping.

INT. LA CONCHA MOTEL - DAY

They have finished making love. NICKY is zipping up his pants. 
GINGER still sits on the bed smoking a cigarette.

                      NICKY
          Hey, Ginger... don't forget, if you're 
          challenged, you know, if he asks 
          anything, deny everything.
               (He walks up to her.)
          Do you understand? I don't want him 
          bringin' beefs back home ... 'cause 
          that could be a problem. You gotta 
          be careful. He's not dumb, you know? 
          You hear what I'm sayin', right?

Her arm and thigh are bruised.

                      GINGER
          I know. You don't have to tell me 
          that. What do you think, 
               (chuckling)
          I'm stupid?

She takes a drag off her cigarette.

                      NICKY
          Do I think you're stupid? No, I think 
          you're beautiful.
               (He bends down and 
               kisses her.)
          But I gotta go.

He exits.

Slow motion of MARINO walking through the front office past

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE - DAY

MARINO takes a small stack of cash out of his coat. A seated 
GAGGI nods for one of his men to take the money.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...to the point when he walked into 
          the place... he didn't know whether 
          he was gonna be kissed or killed.

GAGGI's man takes the money.

                      GAGGI (O.S.)
          Frankie, I want to ask you something.

                      GAGGI
          It's private... but I want you to 
          tell me the truth.

                      MARINO
          Of course, Remo.

                      GAGGI
          I want you to tell me the truth, 
          mind you.

                      MARINO
          I always tell you the truth, Remo.

                      GAGGI
          Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't 
          be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? 
          Because if he is... it's a problem.

FREEZE FRAME OF MARINO.

                      MARINO (V.O.)
          What could I say? I knew if I gave 
          the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, 
          Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've 
          would up gettin' killed.

FREEZE FRAME OF GAGGI.

                      MARINO (V.O.)
          Because there's one thing about these 
          old timers: They don't like any 
          fuckin' around with the other guy's 
          wives. It's bad for business.

ON MARINO'S FREEZE FRAME.

                      MARINO (V.O.)
          So, I lied... even though I knew 
          that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind 
          up gettin' killed too.

UNFREEZE - LIVE ACTION CONTINUES.

                      MARINO
               (To GAGGI)
          No. I ain't see anything like that.

                      GAGGI
          Are you sure?

                      MARINO
          I'm positive.  Remo... things are 
          very fucked up down there, you know?

                      GAGGI
          Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. 
          You see, my main concern is Nicky.

                      MARINO
          Hm.

                      GAGGI
          I want to know... if he's doin' all 
          right. If he's okay.

                      MARINO
          He's good. He's fine.

                      GAGGI
          I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an 
          eye on Nicky. Do it for me.

                      MARINO
          No problem.

                      GAGGI
          You see... I wouldn't want to be 
          jeopardizing anything for people who 
          are our friends. You understand?

                      MARINO
          I understand.

                      GAGGI
          Okay.
               (Pause.)
          Frankie, you're a good boy.

Pats MARINO's hand.

                      MARINO
          Thanks, Remo.

GAGGI drinks from his espresso cup. So does MARINO, looking 
over cautiously at the old man.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          By now, Nicky and his crew had already

          got to him.

EXT. BAR PARKING LOT, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

NICKY is punching a man who is leaning against a car. They 
are surrounded by MARINO, FUSCO, BLUE and HARDY. The man 
remains erect.

          The booze, the coke, the broads... I 
          mean, he got sloppy.  He just wasn't 
          the same Nicky anymore.

DOMINICK takes over. Exhausted, NICKY walks to his car and 
leans on the open car door.

                      MARINO
               (To NICKY)
          You must have drunk too much.

                      NICKY
          Go fuck yourself.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I heard one night he had to belt a 
          guy three times before he finally 
          went down.

DOMINICK finally knocks the man down.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          In the old days, Nicky would've decked

The man is left alone on the ground of the dingy parking 
lot.

BLUE is yelling back at the COPS, holding the foil package.

          night and they started shootin' up

NICKY and MARINO emerge from the shop.

          I mean, it got to the point where 
          they couldn't even talk in the Gold

          wire in the wall.

EXT. FBI STAKEOUT POST: MOTEL ACROSS FROM THE GOLD RUSH - 
DAY

Two FBI AGENTS with binoculars are watching NICKY and MARINO,

          And even when they talked outside, 
          they had to cover their mouths

               (Lowering his 
               binoculars)
          Jeez, he's coverin' up again.

He raises the binoculars and looks through again.

          ...the Feds brought in lip-readers.

EXT. GOLD RUSH - DAY

NICKY and MARINO are outside talking. They are covering their 
mouths with their hands and constantly looking around.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Nicky found out about it from a teller 
          who owed him money.  This guy 
          worked...

Voice-over trails off.

                      MARINO
          He asked me again about you and the 
          Jew's wife.

                      NICKY
          Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?

                      MARINO
          He asked me again about you and the 
          Jew's wife.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, what'd you tell him?

                      MARINO
          I told him I didn't know nothin'. 
          But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said 
          if you did anything, you're fucked 
          up.

                      NICKY
          You think he's goin' home, makin' a 
          beef behind my back?

                      MARINO
          Nah. You would've heard somethin'.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, what's to stop him?

                      MARINO
          I know. I know.

                      NICKY
          I don't trust him anymore. But they'd 
          never okay anything, you know?

                      MARINO
          Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.

                      NICKY
          Well, now, sure they're askin'. They 
          earn with the prick. I got a funny 
          feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' 
          war or somethin'.
               (Pause)
          I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- 
          You know, but you know what I want 
          you to do?

                      MARINO
          What?

NICKY looks suspiciously at a man walking by them.

                      NICKY
          Who's this guy? Who's this guy?

                      MARINO
          Oh, he ain't nobody.

                      NICKY
          You know what I want you to do? Get 
          a couple of guys to dig a hole in 
          the desert, then let 'em show you 
          where it's at.

                      MARINO
          Angelo and Buster.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.

                      MARINO
          They'll do it.

                      NICKY
          And when I'm ready, I'll say the 
          words, 'Go see the Jew.'

                      MARINO
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          And you make it disappear, you know 
          what I mean?

                      MARINO
          Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta 
          be ready. You know what I'm talkin' 
          about?

                      NICKY
          Did I say to do anything yet? I said 
          I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I 
          want to think about it. Where're 
          these pricks at?

Looks for the FBI AGENTS.

                      MARINO
          Don't know.

                      NICKY
          Dominick said they're in the motel?

                      MARINO
          Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' 
          bank. I don't know. They're all over 
          the joint.

                      RUDY
               (Over telephone)
          Yeah, he just left.

                      NICKY
          Yeah? All right.

He hangs up the phone and looks across the room at GINGER, 
who is seated in a booth smiling at him and picking the olive 
out of a Martini.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

ACE gets home and can't find GINGER.

                      ACE
               (Looking around the 
               house)
          Hello? Hello! Ginger.

                      AMY
               (Faintly, from her 
               bedroom)
          Help, Daddy!

Fear strikes him and he runs to his daughter's room.

                      ACE
               (Knocking, turning 
               the doorknob)
          Amy! Amy, open the door!

                      AMY (O.S.)
               (From her room)
          I can't! I'm tied!

                      ACE
          Wh-wh -

ACE slams his shoulder against the door, trying to knock it 
down.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, AMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ACE forces it open and sees that AMY's arms have been tied 
to her bed with stockings. AMY screams.

                      AMY
          Dad!

                      ACE
          What happened? What happened? Who 
          did this to you?

                      AMY
          Mommy.

                      ACE
          I'm gonna get a knife and cut you 
          loose, honey, I'll -

                      AMY
               (Panting)
          Oh, no, please, please.

She tries to keep him from leaving her.

                      ACE
               (Bending down, kisses 
               her)
          Okay, I'll be right back.

ACE cuts AMY loose with a knife.

                      ACE
          When did this happen, honey?

                      AMY
          I don't know.

She gets up and hugs her father.

                      ACE
          You don't know? What time did your 
          mother do this? When did she leave?

                      AMY
          I don't know.

                      ACE
               (Comforting AMY as 
               she moans)
          Ohhh...

He kisses her. They get up from the bed when the phone rings.

               (Into telephone)
          Uh, all right.

He hangs up and steps over to DOMINICK and MARINO.

                      NICKY
          He's comin' over.

                      DOMINICK
          Great!

INT. LEANING TOWER - NIGHT

High angle past the restaurant's neon sign to ACE's car 
screeching to a halt by the main entrance. He storms in.

INT. LEANING TOWER - NIGHT

ACE is stopped by NICKY in the foyer.

                      NICKY
               (Trying to calm him)
          Ace don't... listen, don't... don't 
          make a scene, all right?

                      ACE
          I want to just talk. I want to talk 
          to that Irish bitch.

                      NICKY
          She didn't know who to turn to.
               (Raising his hand 
               almost in a plea.)
          She... she didn't know where to turn. 
          She was tryin' to save your marriage.

                      ACE
          Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that 
          fuckin' bitch.

                      NICKY
               (Menacing)
          Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. 
          Don't fuck up in here.

ACE pauses for a beat, realizing that NICKY is standing in 
his way and could be dangerous. ACE gives him a wide berth.

We follow ACE through the crowd to GINGER, seated in a booth. 
He sits down angrily across from her.)

                      GINGER
               (Stoned, smoking a 
               cigarette)
          Hi, Sam.

                      ACE

          child. Are you out of your fuckin' 
          mind?

                      GINGER
          It's just for a little while, Sam. 
          The baby-sitter wasn't there.

                      ACE
          I ought to fuckin' have you committed. 
          You fuckin' do that again,

               at her)
          I'll f-, I'll f-

                      GINGER
          She wasn't gonna get up. I was just

                      ACE
          I should have -

                      GINGER
          I mean, she was asleep. I was going 
          to be right back before she even 
          woke up.

                      ACE
          Listen to me, listen to me, listen 
          to me.

               the table.)
          Listen, you fuckin' cunt.

                      GINGER
          Oh, sh-

                      ACE
          Listen to me.

                      GINGER
          Fuck you.

                      ACE
               (Knocking her drink 
               over)
          Let me tell you something.
               (Pointing.)
          Listen to me.

                      GINGER
          I w- I was gonna be back before she 
          woke up.

                      ACE
          You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' 
          touch her again, you ever do anything 
          like that again, I'll fuckin' kill 
          you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear 
          me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll 
          fuckin' kill you, you bitch.

                      GINGER
               (Leaning in to him)
          Why don't you just let me go, Sam?

                      ACE
          You fuckin' whore!

                      GINGER
          I'll sign anything you want me to 
          sign, okay?

                      ACE
          You understand? What? Let you go?

                      GINGER
          I just want the key to my jewelry, 
          and I want you to let me go.

                      ACE
          You want your jewelry?

                      GINGER
          I want you to let me go.

                      ACE
          And what? And let you disgrace me, 
          you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace 
          me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. 
          Get in the car and go to the house...

GINGER darts a look to NICKY who is at the bar, watching 
anxiously. He gestures with his head for her to leave.

                      ACE
          Right now. Get up and -

ACE notices her look at NICKY but when he turns to see what 
she's looking at, he just misses NICKY's gesture. ACE grabs 
GINGER by her collar.

                      ACE
          Get - Get up! Get up!

                      GINGER
          I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were 
          you.

                      ACE
          Get - get up!

                      GINGER

                      ACE
          Get up! Get going!
               (Pushing the table.)
          Get up!

NICKY gestures to her again.

                      GINGER
          I wouldn't -

                      ACE
          Get the fu-
               (Shaking the table.)
          You threatening me?
               (Making a fist.)
          I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!
               (Pointing to her.)
          Get up and go home right now.

GINGER gets up and leans in to shout at ACE.

                      GINGER
               (Barking)
          I'm going. I'm going, you -!

She grabs her purse and leaves. Patrons stare as ACE follows 
her out.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, FOYER - NIGHT

GINGER follows ACE through the door. As soon as she closes 
the door behind her, ACE turns to face her.

                      ACE
          Now you need approval from him to go 
          home?

                      GINGER
          So what? So who fuckin' blew you in 
          the parking lot before you came in... 
          huh?

                      ACE
               (Disgusted)
          You make me sick, you fuck. Once a 
          fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.

                      GINGER
          Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!
               (Opening the door.)
          Fuck you!

A furious GINGER turns around and storms out, slamming the 
door.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

Through the kitchen sliding glass door: GINGER's engine roars 
and tires screech as she tears away in her her sportscar. 
ACE dials the phone.

               (Into telephone)
          Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put

EXT. LEANING TOWER - NIGHT

GINGER's car screeches into the parking lot and she jumps 
out, leaving her car oor open and engine running. A valet 
parker approaches.

                      GINGER
               (To VALET PARKER)
          Leave it where it is.

INT. LEANING TOWER, FOYER - NIGHT

GINGER bursts in. MARINO tries to calm her down.

                      GINGER
          Where is he? Goddamn it! I want that 
          Jew bastard killed! I have fuckin' 
          had it!

NICKY walks in from the restaurant.

                      MARINO
          Calm down, calm down. Shh!

                      NICKY
          Shh.
               (To MARINO.)
          Hide her car in the back!

He pulls her by her arm to a storage room upstairs.

                      GINGER
          There's no reason to hide my car. He 
          already knows! 
               (Walking up the stairs.)
          He threw it in my face! The second I 
          get out of here, I -

INT. LEANING TOWER, UPSTAIRS STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

GINGER is enraged and panting.

                      NICKY
          What did I tell you? Supposing he 
          goes back home and makes a fuckin' 
          beef?  I gotta know exactly what you 
          said. Tell me what you said to him.

                      GINGER
          Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I 
          said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he 
          said, I just kept sayin' no.

                      NICKY
          I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. 
          Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a 
          dangerous situation. Be very careful.' 
          You fuckin' yessed me to death.

                      GINGER
          If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then 
          why don't you kill him?

                      NICKY
          I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the 
          fuck up. What, do you know what you're 
          talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-

          get it over with.

               (Loud and angry)
          Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, 
          will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' 
          guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna 
          fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... 
          motherfucker! I knew this, I knew 
          it.

                      GINGER
          What about my money?

                      NICKY
               (Raising his voice 
               even more)
          How the fuck am I gonna get your 
          fuckin' money now? You think he's 
          gonna give you fuckin' money? Are 
          you out of your mind?!  Look what 
          you just did to this fuckin' guy!  
          If you would have just kept your 
          fuckin' mouth shut!
               (Walking away.)
          Ah, what the fuck is the use? I 
          should've never got invol-

GINGER screams and attacks NICKY.

                      NICKY
               (Grappling with her)
          What? Hey! Hey! What the fuck are 
          you... ?

NICKY slaps her roughly across the face, grabs the back her 
jacket and forcefully leads her to a stairway.

                      GINGER
          Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' 
          asshole!

                      NICKY
          Get the fuck out of here. Get out! 
          Get the fuck out!

Shoves her down the stairs. GINGER yells and gasps on her 
way down.

                      MARINO (O.S.)
          (From bottom of stairway)
          Whoa. Calm down.

                      NICKY
               (Behind GINGER)
          Get out. Get out! Get out!

                      MARINO (O.S.)
          Take it easy!

                      NICKY
          Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' 
          nut in the first place? Get out!

                      MARINO
          You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take 
          it easy.

                      NICKY
               (Pushing a sobbing 
               GINGER out the back 
               door)
          Get her the fuck out of here. Get 
          her out of here.

EXT. LEANING TOWER, BACK DOOR/REAR PARKING LOT - NIGHT

MARINO throws GINGER out the back door. She falls on her 
side, crying.

                      NICKY
          Get the fuck out of here.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing, getting up)
          I don't need you! I have my own 
          fuckin' money!

                      NICKY
          All right, all right.

She stumbles to her car.

                      GINGER
          I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared 
          anymore!

                      NICKY
          All right. Be careful.

                      GINGER
          You fucked with me for the last time!

                      NICKY
          Okay, yeah.

INT. LEANING TOWER, BACK DOOR - NIGHT

NICKY and MARINO are seated at the back door watching GINGER 
screech out of the parking lot.

                      NICKY
          Be careful.
               (To MARINO.)
          Hey, come on. Get inside.

They turn and walk back inside. MARINO leans on a wall next 
to the kitchen.

NICKY has scratches on his hand and face.

                      NICKY
          Can you fuckin' believe that?
               (Showing MARINO his 
               scratches.)
          Look at this motherfucker.

NICKY sits on the bottom step across from MARINO, who sighs. 
Cooks mill around in the background.

                      NICKY
          I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up 
          good this time. Should have never 
          started with this fuckin' broad.

                      MARINO
          Take it easy. What could you do? I 
          mean, she threw herself at you, right?

                      NICKY
          I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You 
          know that? Bad fuckin' spot.

He puts his head in his hands.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

We see SHERBERT approach the sliding glass door holding a 
shotgun. ACE lets him in, locks the door and grabs the gun 
from him.

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - NIGHT

Through the sliding patio doors, we see ACE and SHERBERT 
making sure all the doors are locked and the lights are turned 
off.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I already left the kid with neighbors 
          and I had about a million in cash 
          and jewels that I gave to Sherbert 
          to lock up in the hotel.

                      ACE (O.S.)
               (From following scene)
          Put this in the...

INT. ACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

ACE leads SHERBERT to the front door as he stuffs a shoebox 
filled with cash and jewels in a bag and hands it over to 
him.

                      ACE
          ...hotel safe, then I want you to 
          come right back. 

ACE shuts the down behind him and switches off a light. The 
room goes black.

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - MORNING

A crisp, sunny morning. SHERBERT's car is parked on the street 
in front of the house.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS DEN - MORNING

An exhausted ACE, in his robe, and SHERBERT are seated across 
from each other at the bar with the shotgun displayed 
prominently on the counter between them.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, ACE'S HOUSE - MORNING

Camera pans with GINGER's car as it approaches the driveway 
and crashes into the back of ACE's parked car.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS DEN - MORNING

ACE and SHERBERT react to the noise. SHERBERT grabs the 
shotgun. ACE looks out the window at GINGER ramming her car 
into his.

                      ACE
          She, she's alone. Just go. Take the 
          gun and go into Amy's.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
               (Screaming)
          You get down here!

                      ACE
               (To SHERBERT as he 
               walks around the bar 
               with the gun)
          Just wait there for me!

                      GINGER
               (From driveway)
          Get down here and talk to me, goddamn 
          it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You 
          motherfucker!

SHERBERT exits. ACE runs over to the stairs and starts down 
them.

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - MORNING

GINGER repeatedly smashes into ACE's car.

                      GINGER
               (From her car)
          I mean it!

ACE emerges from the front door, taking cover behind a brick 
column.

                      GINGER
          You come down here right now! Come 
          down here and talk to me, goddamn 
          it! Fuck you! Goddamn you, come out 
          here!  I'm gonna drive this fucking 
          car through the living-room!

She starts to drive it across the lawn. ACE darts back towards 
the front door. GINGER's car stops in front of the porch.

                      GINGER
               (Getting out of the 
               car to confront ACE)
          You fucking coward! You motherfucker!

She slips and falls on the lawn.

                      GINGER
          You come out here and talk to me, 
          you fucker!

                      ACE
               (From the porch)
          Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're 
          on drugs. You're gonna -

                      GINGER
          I am not!

                      ACE
               (Pointing to her)
          You're gonna be sorry if you don't 
          stop that.

                      GINGER
          Don't you threaten me!

                      ACE
          You'll wake the whole neighborhood!

                      GINGER
               (Kicking the hedges)
          Don't you threaten me!

EXT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET - MORNING

A female neighbor walks out of her house. A man from the 
house next door does the same. We see AMY watching from the 
neighbor's window.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
          You are not threatening me anymore!

                      ACE (O.S.)
          I'm not -

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - MORNING

GINGER is bending down, breaking off branches from some plants 
and throwing them at ACE.

                      GINGER
          You fuck! You fuck! I'm sick of you!

ACE flinches as a handful of leaves hits his face.

                      GINGER
          I am fuckin' Nicky Santoro! I am! 
          He's my new sponsor!

ACE gestures towards the neighbors who are watching. A squad 
car pulls into the driveway.

                      GINGER
               (To ACE)
          What about that, you fuckhead?!
               (To neighbors.)
          What are you looking at? Fuck off!

Two COPS walk up the driveway towards GINGER.

                      COP #1

          business!

EXT. FBI SURVEILLANCE CAMPER - MORNING

An FBI AGENT is parked down the block, photographing the 
scene through a long-lens camera.

          Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. 
          We've got some complaints about - 
          about the noise.

                      GINGER
          I'm just trying to get in my house!

                      COP #1
          I understand.

                      GINGER
          He won't let me go in my house!

                      ACE
          I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, 
          I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, 
          I'm not gonna let her in, the way 
          she's behaving. I'm - I'm -

                      GINGER
          Not gonna let me in?

                      ACE
          Who knows what you're gonna do in 
          there? I don't want you -

                      GINGER
          What do you mean, what am I gonna 
          do? I'm in the same clothes for two 
          days! I want to get a few of my 
          things! Big deal!

                      COP #1
          All right. Okay, okay.

                      COP #2
          Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let 
          her in the house and get a few of 
          her things?  That way she'll get out 
          of here. This is half her house 
          anyway.

                      ACE
          I'm afraid to let her in the house.

                      GINGER
          Oh, you are...

                      ACE
          I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.

               (Kicking, pulling up 
               plants and throwing 
               them at ACE)
          Let me in the house! Fucker!

COP #1 holds her back.

                      GINGER
          Fucker!

                      COP #1
          Please.

                      ACE
          Should I let her in like - ?

          You ought to be afraid, the way you 
          fuckin' treat me!

                      COP #1
          Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a 
          lot easier on everybody here if we 
          just let her in the house.

                      COP #2
          If we let her get a few of her things 
          we'll be out of your hair.

                      ACE
          If she calms down, I will let her in 
          the house.

          Jeff, would you go in with her?

GINGER walks towards the front door.

                      COP #2
          We can do that. Absolutely. Yes. 
          Absolutely.

          Yes, fine!  Fine!

          Fuck you!

EXT. FBI SURVEILLANCE CAMPER - MORNING

The FBI AGENT taking photographs.

We see a series of surveillance photos of GINGER, ACE and 
the COPS on the front lawn.

EXT. NEIGHBOR'S WINDOWS - MORNING

AMY is watching her parents and the COPS across the street, 
until the housekeeper pulls her away into the house.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
               (From following scene)
          You wouldn't believe how mean he's 
          been to me. He's locked up...

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS DEN - MORNING

GINGER races up the stairs, trailed by COP #2.

                      GINGER
          ...most of my important stuff, all 
          my papers and things. And I have to 
          get 'em.

She walks across the room to ACE's desk.

                      GINGER
          So don't let him come in here 'cause 
          I know they're in here in the desk 
          and he's -

She tries to open the middle drawer but it's locked.

                      GINGER
          Fuck!
               (Going through a couple 
               of drawers.)
          Just pay attention. He could come up 
          here at any time.
               (Pants.)

She spots a pair of scissors on the desk. She tries to open 
the drawer with them.

                      GINGER
               (Then, to COP #2)
          Are you watching for him?

She finally pries the drawer open, breaking the tip of the 
scissors.  GINGER's hands open the drawer and she picks up 
the safe deposit keys.

               (Smoking, checking 
               his watch)
          Yeah, I don't want her in there more 
          than a few more minutes.

                      COP #1
          No, it's - it'll just be a couple of 
          minutes. We got other things to do 
          too, you know. He'll hurry her up. 
          How's everything else besides this?

                      ACE
          Fine, fine. How's your family?

                      COP #1
          Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my 
          wife's pregnant again.

                      ACE
          Oh, good.

                      COP #1
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          Congratulations.

ACE shakes his hand.

                      COP #1
          Thanks, yeah... I'm kind of happy 
          about this, you know.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM CLOSET - MORNING

GINGER runs into the closet, bending down to search through 
the shoe boxes that usually contain money but are now empty.

                      GINGER
               (Kneeling, to COP #2)
          I just have to get this one more 
          thing and then we'll be - We can go.
               (She picks up an empty 
               shoe box.)
          Shit!
               (Gets up, picking up 
               a pair of ACE's shoes 
               and tossing them on 
               the floor.)
          God, fuck! Shit! God!
               (She runs out, taking 
               a fur coat off a 
               hangar. Then, grunting)
          Really pisses me off... 
               (To COP #2.)
          Don't worry about it.

COP #2 follows her out of the closet.

               (To the COPS but 
               looking at ACE)
          And it would be great if you guys 
          could follow me out of here, because 
          he's been threatening me.

GINGER walks to her car.

                      COP #2
               (To COP #1)
          Come on. I'm sorry.

                      COP #1
          Okay.

                      ACE
               (to COP #1, shaking 
               hands)
          Okay, Randy. Thank you.

                      COP #1
          All right, take care.

               (Sighs.)

EXT. VEGAS BANK - MORNING

GINGER swerves into the bank, parks in front of the main

                      GINGER
               (To COPS, rushing 
               inside)
          I just need to pick up a little cash 
          inside.  Could you come with me?

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS DEN - MORNING

ACE is on the phone talking to CHARLIE CLARK. He's looking 
at the jimmied rawer, broken scissors and the missing keys.

                      ACE
               (Into telephone, 
               throwing the scissors 
               into the open drawer)
          Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta 
          stop her!

          What can I do?

          She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of

INT. VEGAS BANK - MORNING

CHARLIE CLARK is on the phone. GINGER, in the background, 
comes out of the vault and carries one of her boxes to a 
cubicle.

                      CHARLIE CLARK
               (Into telephone)
          ...the keys, and it's still in both 
          your names.

                      GINGER
               (Carrying the box, 
               slipping but catching 
               herself)
          Whoa.

                      CHARLIE CLARK
               (Into telephone)
          I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

                      CHARLIE CLARK

          Legally, she can't take the stuff.

               (Over telephone)
          No, Ace.

               (Into telephone)
          Half of everything is mine.

                      CHARLIE CLARK
               (Over telephone)
          Ace, listen to me.

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)

               (He hangs up.)

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE, DRIVEWAY - MORNING

ACE and SHERBERT get into ACE's damaged car. A metal strip

pull out.

INT. VEGAS BANK - DAY

GINGER opens the safe deposit box, which is filled with bound 
stacks of cash.

She grabs handfuls in a frenzy, some fall off the counter to 
the floor.

                      GINGER
          Shit! Oh, goddamn it!

GINGER gets down on the floor to pick them up.

                      GINGER
               (Then, to COPS who 
               are watching)
          Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you 
          could just ask the guy for a big 
          bag, okay?

                      COP #1
               (To COP #2)
          Go get a bag, man.

                      GINGER
               (Looking up, offering 
               COP #1 some cash)
          And here. Here.

COP #2 exits.

                      GINGER
          No, you can, you can.
               (Sobbing.)
          You've been so nice to me.

                      COP #1
               (Taking the money)
          I can't.

INT. VEGAS BANK - MORNING, A LITTLE LATER

COP #2 holds open a large canvas bag for GINGER.

                      COP #2
               (To GINGER)
          Like this?

                      GINGER
               (Struggling with two 
               handfuls of cash)
          Yeah, just hold the top open, all 
          right, and I can -

She starts to stuff the money in the bag.

EXT. FBI SURVEILLANCE CAR, ACROSS THE STREET - MORNING

The FBI AGENTS photograph GINGER leaving the bank.

EXT. VEGAS BANK - DAY

GINGER throws the canvas bag into the trunk of her car when, 
suddenly, she sees ACE's beat-up Cadillac approaching. She 
gasps.

                      GINGER
          Oh, God. It's him.
               (To COPS.)
          You have to stop him. You have to - 
          'Cause he said he was going to kill 
          me.

ACE jumps out of his car and runs toward GINGER, SHERBERT 
follows him out.

ACE is intercepted by the COPS who hold him back.

                      GINGER
          You just - Just stop him.

                      COP #1
          Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where 
          you goin' -

                      ACE
          Stop -

                      COP #1
          Wait, hold on a second.

                      ACE
          Hey!

                      COP #1
          Hold on a second.

The COPS huddle around ACE and SHERBERT until GINGER's car 
pulls out of the bank.

                      COP #1
          Nothin' we can do about it. Nothin' 
          we can do. There's nothin' we can 
          do.

ACE, unable to pursue, watches GINGER speed away.

                      ACE
          Look, look. You can't stop her for 
          speeding? I mean, look what the hell 
          she's doing.

                      COP #1
          Speeding?

                      COP #2
          We're talkin' to you right now.

GINGER's car disappears into traffic. The FBI car across the 
street follows right behind her.

                      COP #2
          There's nothing we can do. She had 
          the key.

                      COP #1
          She's on the account. There's nothing 
          we can do.

EXT. FBI SURVEILLANCE CAR - MORNING

The AGENTS are following GINGER.

                      FBI AGENT #1
          Let's pull her over at that Citgo 
          Station.

                      FBI AGENT #2
               (Driving)
          Okay, let's do it.

FBI AGENT #1 puts a siren on top of the car's roof.

EXT. VEGAS STREET, CITGO STATION - MORNING

GINGER pulls over at a gas station, the FBI car with siren 
blaring right behind her.

EXT. VEGAS BANK - MORNING

A powerless ACE and SHERBERT are still standing in front of 
the bank with the COPS. COP #2 gives ACE a 'sorry' gesture.

EXT. CITGO STATION - MORNING

GINGER and the FBI AGENTS are standing by her car. She is 
distraught.

                      FBI AGENT #2
          We're - we're placing you under arrest 
          for -

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          For what?

                      FBI AGENT #2
          We're placing you under arrest for 
          aiding and abetting -

                      GINGER
               (Through tears)
          What?

                      FBI AGENT #2
          We're placing you under arrest for 
          aiding and abetting a -

                      GINGER
               (Crying)
          But I'm just trying to leave.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          After all the threats and all the 
          bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't 
          tell 'em anything. But by then, the 
          Feds didn't need her, anyway.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          But it was just mine.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They had all the pieces they needed.

                      FBI AGENT #1
          Come on.

                      GINGER
          But I didn't do anything.

The AGENTS escort GINGER to their car.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And everybody...

EXT. GOLD RUSH - NIGHT

Twelve FBI AGENTS with rifles, wearing 'FBI' armbands, charge 
into the parking lot and rush through the front door.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...began to tumble.

                      FBI AGENT #3
          FBI! We have a warrant!

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...one after the other... just like 
          dominoes. Between Piscano complaining 
          on a wire.

EXT. GOLD RUSH - NIGHT, A LITTLE LATER

The FBI AGENTS escort DOMINICK, HARDY, FUSCO and MARINO out 
of the front of the shop.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Between Nicky, Ginger, me and my 
          license... paradise... we managed to 
          really fuck it all up.

INT. NICKY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

We hear a doorbell ring. LITTLE NICKY, now ten years old, 
see FBI AGENTS approaching the house.

                      LITTLE NICKY
               (Getting up from the 
               couch)
          Mom!

                      JENNIFER (O.S.)
               (Into telephone)
          Yeah, well, someone's at the fuckin' 
          door now.

Jennifer's cousin opens the door; seven AGENTS storm in.

                      FBI AGENT #4
          FBI. We have a federal search warrant.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Right away, I got wind of the pinches 
          comin' down, so I took off. Who needs 
          to hang around for that bullshit?

                      FBI AGENT #4
               (To JENNIFER, showing 
               his badge)
          My name is Marc Caspar, Special Agent, 
          FBI.

                      JENNIFER
               (Defensive)
          Yeah, well,
               (grabbing the phone 
               and walking away)
          Can I make a fuckin' phone call?

                      FBI AGENT #4
               (Blocking her way as 
               she tries to get by 
               him)
          Hey, ho-hold it for a minute. You 
          can make a phone call, but you don't 
          have to talk to us like that.

                      JENNIFER
               (Slamming the phone 
               down on a table)
          Hey -

INT. TANGIERS CASHIER'S CAGE - DAY

NANCE is talking to a cashier behind the cage when FBI AGENTS 
with Gaming Board investigators DUPREY and AUSTIN enter the 
casino.

                      FBI AGENT #5
          FBI! Don't be alarmed.

NANCE rushes out a back door.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But they got almost everybody else.

                      FBI AGENT #5
          This area is seized.

                      DUPREY
          Grab everything in sight.

                      FBI AGENT #6
          Right.

                      DUPREY
               (Walking through a 
               door into the cage)
          Get the master account list!

                      AUSTIN
          I want all those papers seized, 
          regardless of what they are.

As AUSTIN and the others make their way into the soft count 
room, an AGENT puts up a yellow crime banner across the front 
of the cashier's window.

                      AUSTIN
          I want this area off-limits to 
          everybody.

INT. TANGIERS SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY

The counters look on as several AGENTS seize the money boxes 
and stacks of cash from the glass table. DUPREY sifts through 
the Count Room Executive's notebook.

AUSTIN is at a cabinet looking through a ledger.

                      AUSTIN
               (Holding the book)
          Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps 
          figures.  [Actual amount taken from 
          craps tables before the skim.] Hey - 
          Hey.

          Green?

INT. GREEN'S MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT

GREEN, wearing a tennis outfit and holding a racquet, is 
being questioned by FBI AGENT #8 who's showing him confiscated 
papers. Several AGENTS are searching the house.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Don't even ask.

                      FBI AGENT #8
          Thirty thousand dollars...

                      GREEN
          No, he didn't. And that's why it 
          wasn't valid. I was being extorted, 
          all right?  I'm willing to tell you 
          whatever you want to know. I've got 
          nothin' to hide here.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now, for the best...

INT. PISCANO'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM, KANSAS CITY - DAY

FBI AGENT #9 removes some ledgers from a a filing cabinet.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...and I couldn't believe this shit. 
          Piscano's expense reports took the 
          cake.

AGENTS are wandering around the house, looking for evidence.

                      FBI AGENT #9
          Oh, this is good. Bingo!

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He might as well have given them a 
          fuckin' blueprint.  Everybody's names, 
          address, dates, everything.

                      FBI AGENT #9
               (Crossing the room to 
               PISCANO)
          Look at this! That you so much, Mr 
          Piscano. How considerate of you. 
          Appreciate it.

                      PISCANO
          Those are my m- those are my mother's 
          books.

                      FBI AGENT #10
          You're under arrest.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          What a fuckin' balloon head.

PISCANO gets more and more agitated as FBI AGENT #10 gets 
one cuff on him.

                      PISCANO
          What are you guys doin'?!

PISCANO gasps and clutches his chest, having a heart attack. 
The AGENT drops the cuffs and tries to help PISCANO as he 
collapses onto the floor.

                      FBI AGENT #10
          Take it easy, Artie. We just want to 
          talk to you.

PISCANO'S WIFE and the FBI AGENTS kneel down beside him.

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
               (Screaming)
          Artie, are you okay? Sweetheart? 
          Honey? Wait a minute! He's sick! 
          Artie! Oh, God!

She continues to scream as the AGENTS try to revive him.

                      FBI AGENT #10
               (To PISCANO's wife)
          Move back! Come on!

                      FBI AGENT #9
          Dave!

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
          He's sick! It's his heart!

                      FBI AGENT #9
          CPR! Now!

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
          Oh, God, is he breathing? He's not 
          breathing!

An FBI AGENT gives him mouth-to-mouth.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Poor Artie. He got so upset he had a 
          heart attack and dropped dead right 
          there in front of his wife.

FBI AGENTS #9 and #10 restrain PISCANO'S hysterical WIFE.

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
          Artie!

                      FBI AGENT #10
          Calm down! Calm down!

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
          No, I won't calm down! He's my 
          husband!

                      FBI AGENT #10
          Stay out of the way!

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
          Artie! Artie!

                      FBI AGENT #10
          We can't help him if -

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - DAY

ACE opens his front door and is confronted by two FBI AGENTS. 
He is shown pictures of NICKY and GINGER at the construction 
site.

                      ACE (V.O.)
               (Quietly)
          And at the end of the day, they 
          finally came to see me with the 
          pictures.

                      FBI AGENT #1
               (Pointing to the 
               pictures)
          Why protect a friend who betrayed 
          you like that?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But I didn't want to look at 'em. I 
          didn't want to look at the guys who 
          brought 'em either.

ACE refuses to look at the photos and quietly closes the 
door on the AGENTS.

INT. FEDERAL COURT-HOUSE - DAY

GAGGI, FORLANO, BORELLI and CAPELLI are all in court. FORLANO 
and CAPELLI are breathing through masks and oxygen tanks 
with nearby doctors and nurses. GAGGI

has a cane in front of him. Several court spectators look 
on. We hear the bosses' lawyer speak.

                      LAWYER
          Your Honor, as you can see, my clients 
          are elderly and infirm. Any 
          incarceration could pose a serious 
          health risk. They are no danger to 
          the community and they pose no flight 
          risk.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          When the bosses were arrested, some 
          of 'em were so old they needed doctors 
          at their arraignment.

                      LAWYER
          And Pre-trial Services recommends 
          that bail remain as presently set.

                      JUDGE
               (Calling a recess)
          We're going to take a ten-minute 
          recess.

The JUDGE pounds his gavel.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          And when it looked like they could 
          get twenty-five years... 

The BOSSES, their nurses and lawyer file through a side court 
door.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...to life in prison, just for 
          skimmin' a casino... sick or no 
          fuckin' sick, you knew people were 
          gonna get clipped. So, the day of 
          the arraignment, they had this meeting 
          right in the back of the court-house.

INT. COURT-HOUSE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The BOSSES are gathered around a conference table as the 
lawyers and nurses silently walk out the door as if on cue.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          See, when something like this happens, 
          you know how things are gonna work 
          out. It's always better with no 
          witnesses. So, what about Andy?

THE CAMERA PANS FROM ONE BOSS TO THE OTHER.

                      FORLANO
               (Putting down his 
               oxygen mask once the 
               door behind him is 
               shut)
          He won't talk. Stone is a good kid. 
          Stand-up guy, just like his old man. 
          That's the way I see it.

                      BORELLI
          I agree. He's solid. A fuckin' Marine.

                      CAPELLI
               (Holding his oxygen 
               mask)
          He's okay. He always was. Remo, what 
          do you think?

                      GAGGI
               (Pause)
          Look... why take a chance? At least, 
          that's the way I feel about it.

EXT. BACK HOME RESTAURANT, STRIP MALL PARKING LOT - DAY

ANDY STONE and his LAWYER are walking toward their car.

                      STONE
          You call Artie... and you tell him I 
          don't care what, he's gotta be in my 
          office Thursday morning before eleven 
          o'clock.

                      LAWYER
          It's done.

His LAWYER veers to the left, walking away from STONE who 
keeps talking.

                      LAWYER (O.S.)
          It's done.

                      STONE
               (To himself)
          It's terribly important. I gotta 
          have a conversation with this guy. 
          That's all.

GAGGI's men, CURLY and BEEPER, appear from behind STONE and 
shoot him dead.

They empty their silent half-load rounds into STONE even 
after he's down on the snowy ground. They walk away 
discreetly, leaving him partially hidden between cars.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          As much as they liked him, I mean, 
          he wasn't one of us. He wasn't 
          Italian. As far as they knew, he 
          could have talked. Otherwise, Stony 
          might still be alive.

MONTAGE OF MURDERS:

EXT. NANCE'S COSTA RICAN HOUSE - DAY

TITLE IN: COSTA RICA

The camera moves down a waterfall to reveal NANCE's Spanish-
style house.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          The first one to skip was John Nance. 
          He found a nice, warm secluded place 
          in Costa Rica. He thought nobody 
          would find him there.

Several gunshots are heard. NANCE emerges from the house 
through a door and runs along a verandah to another door. He 
breaks a pane of glass, unlocks another door and runs in.  
BEEPER emerges from the first door and follows him back into 
the house. Several more shots are heard. NANCE emerges from 
yet another door, only this time he's been shot in the 
stomach. He painfully staggers away from the hitmen.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But, then, his kid got nabbed by the 
          Feds for drugs, and so naturally the 
          bosses were afraid he'd come out of 
          hidin' just to save his kid and give 
          'em all up.  So...

CURLY and BEEPER come out of the house and approach NANCE 
from behind.

                      CURLY
          Hey, where you goin', jag-off?

NANCE kneels down. CURLY points his gun expertly at the top 
of NANCE's head and fires. Blood splatters from NANCE's mouth 
and he falls to the ground. The gunmen walk away.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But anyway, they, you know, they all 
          had to follow.

EXT. HOLE IN THE DESERT - DUSK

A bound COUNT ROOM EXEC and a CLERK are kneeling next to a 
large pit in the esert ground in front of BEEPER and CURLY.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Everybody went down.

The CLERK groans as he's shot in the head by BEEPER. Blood 
splatters and he falls right into the pre-dug hole.

                      COUNT ROOM EXEC
          Go ahead, fuck...

                      CURLY
          Fuck you.

CURLY shoots the EXEC in the head, he too falls backward 
into the pit. The gunmen fire more rounds into the bodies, 
then toss their guns into the hole.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Before you knew it...

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

RICHIE, a sharply dressed Tangiers EXEC, is getting into his 
new Lincoln.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...anybody who knew anything wound 
          up gettin' whacked.

CURLY sneaks up from behind and hits the EXEC with a lead 
pipe. He puts a plastic bag over his head and begins to choke 
him to death. The EXEC struggles a bit but the bag soon fills 
with blood. CURLY strikes him with the pipe one last time.

INT. BEVERLY SUNSET MOTEL - NIGHT

The camera pans away from an empty registration desk to a 
motel corridor.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
               (Gasping)
          Oh! Oh, no!  No...

The camera moves past several rooms along a cinder block 
wall.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          After Ginger took off, she wasn't 
          much help to anybody. She found some 
          pimps, low-lifes, druggies and bikers 
          in LA. And in a few months, they 
          went through all the money and all 
          the jewels.

Suddenly, a door opens and GINGER overdosing, staggers into 
the hall looking for help. She gasps, goes halfway down the 
seedy corridor towards the desk, but collapses and dies.

FREEZE FRAME ON GINGER SPRAWLED OUT ON THE MOTEL CARPET.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          After they found her body... I had a 
          private doctor do another autopsy. 
          He said they gave her... a hot dose. 
          In the end... all she had left was 
          thirty-six hundred in mint-condition 
          coins.

END OF MONTAGE

EXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

ACE emerges from the restaurant, smoking a cigarette as in 
the first scene in the film. He gets into his car to start 
the ignition.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          No matter what the Feds or the papers 
          might have said about my car 
          bombing...

Flames surge from the windshield, concealing ACE behind the 
wheel.

FLASHBACK: EXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

The sign above him reads: 'Tony Roma's a Place for Ribs'. 
ACE is leaving the restaurant and walking to his car.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...it was amateur night, and you 
          could tell. Whoever it was, they put 
          the dynamite under the passenger 
          side. But what they didn't know, 
          what nobody outside the factory knew, 
          was that that model car was made 
          with a metal plate under the driver's 
          seat. It's the only thing that saved 
          my life.

ACE opens his car door and gets in.

INT. ACE'S CAR, TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

ACE turns on the ignition and we see two- and three-inch 
flames come out of the defroster vents. Everything goes silent 
as he is suddenly engulfed in flames.

The car explodes in flames two storeys high. The screen fills 
with the rising explosion of smoke and fire.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The bombing was never authorized, 
          but I suspect I know who lit the 
          fuse.

EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD - DAY

NICKY, DOMINICK and MARINO get out of a car on a farm road 
for a meeting. FAT SALLY, a heavy-set wiseguy, is already 
there.

                      FAT SALLY (O.S.)
          Hey, Nicky.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And so did the power that be.

                      NICKY
          Hey, Mikey, how's your hernia?

They shake hands.

                      FAT SALLY
          How you doin'?

MARINO approaches NICKY from behind.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          It took months for...

FLASHBACK: EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD - DAY

NICKY's car drives up the farm road to meet his crew.

                      NICKY: (V.O.)
          ...everything to calm down, but 
          finally my guys got out on bail and 
          the bosses wanted me to send my 
          brother Dominick out to Vegas.  Always 
          the dollars, always the fuckin'...

NICKY, DOMINICK and MARINO get out of the car to greet FAT 
SALLY. HARDY, FUSCO and BEEPER are also waiting there, 
smiling.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...dollars. I mean, it was still way 
          too hot for me to even go near Vegas, 
          so I set up a meeting with the guys 
          way out in the sticks. I didn't want 
          my brother to get fucked around.

NICKY shakes hands with SALLY. FUSCO walks up to say hello.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I mean, what's right is right. They 
          don't give a fuck about - urgghh!

MARINO hits NICKY in the back with a bat. FAT SALLY grabs 
him by the throat.

HARDY and BEEPER hold DOMINICK by the arms.

MARINO hits NICKY's legs with the bat.

                      FAT SALLY
          Huh? Come on, you fuckin' rat.

                      DOMINICK
          Fuck!  You...

FUSCO and FAT SALLY pin NICKY down and hold his face straight 
ahead, forcing him to watch his brother being beaten.

                      DOMINICK
               (To MARINO)
          ...rat motherfucker! You rat mother-

MARINO hits DOMINICK in the shoulder with the bat.

                      MARINO
          Tough guy! You and your f-
               (he strikes DOMINICK's 
               chest)
          Fuckin' brother!

                      DOMINICK
          Oh, you - !

NICKY tries to look away.

                      MARINO
          No more!

                      FAT SALLY
          Get him, Marino!

                      MARINO
               (Hitting DOMINICK 
               across the neck)
          You fuckin' scumbag!

The wiseguys hold NICKY's face so he has to see his brother.

                      MARINO
               (Lunging the bat into 
               DOMINICK's stomach)
          No more.

He swings the bat across his head, knocking DOMINICK on the 
ground.

                      NICKY
               (Still pinned, 
               screaming)
          Frankie!

                      MARINO
               (Looking at NICKY as 
               he strikes DOMINICK)
          No more! You see? Watch!

HARDY and BEEPER join MARINO. All three are beating DOMINICK 
with baseball bats.

                      NICKY
               (Held down by his 
               neck)
          Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!

                      MARINO
          Fuck you, you motherfuck!

The camera tilts down to DOMINICK's bloody face as the three 
continue to beat him to death.

                      NICKY
          Fuckin' punk, motherfucker! Piece of 
          shit!

NICKY tries to stand up but FAT SALLY and FUSCO keep him 
down.

                      MARINO
          No more fuckin' dirty work!

                      NICKY
               (Rolling over on his 
               back in pain)
          No, no, no, no!

                      MARINO
               (To HARDY and BEEPER)
          Take him out! Take this motherfucker 
          out!

They drag DOMINICK by his feet. MARINO swings at him with 
two bats as he's taken away into the cornfield.

EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD, GRAVE SITE - DAY, A LITTLE LATER

DOMINICK is battered and bloody. MARINO, HARDY and BEEPER 
stand over him, still swinging their bats.

NICKY is on his side, still held down by SALLY and FUSCO. 
His face is a little bloody.

                      NICKY
               (Whimpering, as they 
               beat DOMINICK)
          Dominick! Oh, Dominick. Oh, Dom.
          Frankie.
               (Pleading for his 
               brother's life.)
          Frankie, leave the kid alone. He's 
          still breathin'. He's still breathin'.  
          Leave him alone. Frankie.

MARINO swings two final blows to DOMINICK's head. NICKY looks 
away, sobbing.

                      MARINO
          All right. Strip him.

MARINO and his hoods remove DOMINICK's pants and shirt.

                      NICKY
               (Sobbing as they 
               undress his brother)
          No balls, you got no fuckin' balls. 
          Oh, Dominick. Oh, Dom.

NICKY sobs. They drag DOMINICK toward a freshly dug grave 
and toss his limp, barely conscious body into it.

                      NICKY
               (Crying quietly)
          Dominick.  Dominick.
               (Sobs.)
          Dominick.

NICKY looks up to MARINO. They share a look before MARINO 
swings his bat, striking NICKY's head.

FREEZE FRAME ON MARINO.

UNFREEZE - LIVE ACTION CONTINUES.

MARINO and his men start beating NICKY, who groans and spits 
blood as he is struck.

EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD, GRAVE SITE - DAY, A LITTLE LATER

NICKY is stripped down to his underwear. HARDY and FUSCO 
drag him to the grave and dump him over DOMINICK.

                      MARINO
          Come on, come on. Bury 'em.

MARINO and BEEPER look on as the other hoods begin the tedious 
work of tossing dirt on to the bodies, shovel by shovel, 
until they are covered up to their necks.

We see NICKY's face, bloodied and battered. He's still 
breathing and groaning.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The word was out. The bosses had had 
          enough of Nicky. They had enough.  
          How much were they gonna take? So, 
          they made an example of him and his 
          brother. They buried them while they 
          were still breathing.

A full shovel of dirt lands upon NICKY's face and chest with 
a thud.

INT. ACE'S CAR, TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DUSK

ACE is engulfed in flames. His jacket catches fire. He opens 
the door and rolls out onto the pavement, barely escaping a 
smaller explosion. He lies on the floor as a ball of fire 
rises behind him. Two men pull him away from the car.

                      MAN #1
          Mister, you all right?

                      MAN #2
          Watch out, the -!

ACE watches as his car explodes in flames. Ashes and debris 
fall on ACE and the two men.

                      MAN #2
          Mister, you all right?

                      ACE
               (Dazed)
          Yeah.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They had other ideas for me.

EXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

ACE is being wheeled to an ambulance on a stretcher. There 
are firemen and policemen in the background.

                      AMBULANCE DRIVER
               (As ACE is wheeled 
               into the rear of the 
               ambulance)
          You sure are lucky, mister.

ACE's face disappears into the ambulance.

EXT. ACE'S SAN DIEGO LUXURY HOME - DAY

TITLE IN: SAN DIEGO

A house very much like ACE's house in Vegas, including the 
fact that it backs up on a golf course. We see ACE inside 
talking on the phone with a bookie.

INT. ACE'S SAN DIEGO LUXURY HOME - DAY

An older, grayer ACE is alone in his living-room with TV 
sets, fax machines and multiple phone lines. He is surrounded 
by newspapers and files. He is very much the way we saw him 
during his earlier handicapping days.

                      RACE ANNOUNCER
               (From a television 
               set)
          They're off and running...

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Probable, but may be questionable. 
          All right. Well, let me know as soon 
          as you can find out.

ACE sets his cordless phone down and jots a few notes on a 
racing form. A television set shows a football game in the 
background.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But in the end, I wound up right 
          back where I started. I could still 
          pick winners, and I could still make 
          money for all kinds of people back 
          home. And why mess up a good thing? 
          And that's that.

He takes off his glasses, and gazes ahead.

							THIRD DRAFT
							October 9, 1973







		1    FULL SCREEN PHOTOGRAPH

			grainy but unmistakably a man and woman making love.
			Photograph shakes. SOUND of a man MOANING in anguish.
			The photograph is dropped, REVEALING ANOTHER, MORE 
			compromising one. Then another, and another. More moans.

							CURLY'S VOICE
						(crying out)
					Oh, no.

		2    INT. GITTES' OFFICE

			CURLY drops the photos on Gittes' desk. Curly towers
			over GITTES and sweats heavily through his workman's
			clothes, his breathing progressively more labored. A
			drop plunks on Gittes' shiny desk top.

			Gittes notes it. A fan whiffs overhead. Gittes glances
			up at it. He looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit
			despite the heat. Never taking his eyes off Curly, he
			lights a cigarette using a lighter with a "nail" on
			his desk.

			Curly, with another anguished sob, turns and rams his
			fist into the wall, kicking the wastebasket as he does.
			He starts to sob again, slides along the wall where his
			fist has left a noticeable dent and its impact has sent
			the signed photos of several movie stars askew.

			Curly slides on into the blinds and sinks to his knees.
			He is weeping heavily now, and is in such pain that he
			actually bites into the blinds.

			Gittes doesn't move from his chair.

							GITTES
					All right, enough is enough --
					you can't eat the Venetian
					blinds, Curly. I just had
					'em installed on Wednesday.

			Curly responds slowly, rising to his feet, crying. Gittes
			reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass, quickly
			selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths
			of more expensive whiskeys.

		3    Gittes pours a large shot. He shoves the glass across
			his desk toward Curly.

							GITTES
					-- Down the hatch.

			Curly stares dumbly at it. Then picks it up, and drains
			it. He sinks back into the chair opposite Gittes, begins
			to cry quietly.

							CURLY
						(drinking, relaxing
						a little)
					She's just no good.

							GITTES
					What can I tell you, Kid?
					You're right. When you're
					right, you're right, and
					you're right.

							CURLY
					-- Ain't worth thinking about.

			Gittes leaves the bottle with Curly.

							GITTES
					You're absolutely right, I
					wouldn't give her another
					thought.

							CURLY
						(pouring himself)
					You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes.
					I know it's your job, but you're
					okay.

							GITTES
						(settling back,
						breathing a little
						easier)
					Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.

							CURLY
					Thanks. You know something, 
					Jake?

							GITTES
					What's that, Curly?

							CURLY
					I think I'll kill her.

		4    INT. DUFFY & WALSH'S OFFICE

			noticeably less plush than Gitte's. A well-groomed,
			dark-haired WOMAN sits nervously between their two desks,
			fiddling with the veil on her pillbox hat.

							WOMAN
					-- I was hoping Mr. Gittes could
					see to this personally --

							WALSH
						(almost the manner
						of someone
						comforting the
						bereaved)
					-- If you'll allow us to complete
					our preliminary questioning, by
					then he'll be free.

			There is the SOUND of ANOTHER MOAN coming from Gittes'
			Office -- something made of glass shatters. The Woman
			grows more edgy.

		5    INT. GITTES' OFFICE - GITTES & CURLY

			Gittes and Curly stand in front of the desk, Gittes
			staring contemptuously at the heavy breathing hulk
			towering over him. Gittes takes a handkerchief and
			wipes away the plunk of perspiration on his desk.

							CURLY
						(crying)
					They don't kill a guy for that.

							GITTES
					Oh they don't?

							CURLY
					Not for your wife. That's the
					unwritten law.

		6    Gittes pounds the photos on the desk, shouting;

							GITTES
					I'll tell you the unwritten law,
					you dumb son of a bitch, you
					gotta be rich to kill somebody,
					anybody and get away with it.
					You think you got that kind
					of dough, you think you got
					that kind of class?

			Curly shrinks back a little.

							CURLY

					... No...

							GITTES
					You bet your ass you don't. You
					can't even pay me off.

			This seems to upset Curly even more.

							CURLY
					I'll pay the rest next trip --
					we only caught sixty ton of
					skipjack around San Benedict.
					We hit a chubasco, they don't
					pay you for skipjack the way
					they do for tuna or albacore --

							GITTES
					(easing him out of
					his office)
					Forget it. I only mention it to
					illustrate a point...

		7    INT. OFFICE RECEPTION

			He's now walking him past SOPHIE who pointedly averts her
			gaze. He opens the door where on the pebbled glass can
			be read: J. J. GITTES and Associates - DISCREET
			INVESTIGATION.

							GITTES
					I don't want your last dime.

			He throws an arm around Curly and flashes a dazzling 
			smile.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					What kind of guy do you
					think I am?

							CURLY 
					Thanks, Mr. Gittes.

							GITTES
					Call me Jake. Careful driving 
					home, Curly.

			He shuts the door on him and the smile disappears.

		8    He shakes his head, starting to swear under his breath.

							SOPHIE
					-- A Mrs. Mulwray is waiting for
					you, with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy.

			Gittes nods, walks on in.

		9    INT. DUFFY AND WALSH'S OFFICE

			Walsh rises when Gittes enters.

							WALSH
					Mrs. Mulwray, may I present Mr.
					Gittes?

			Gittes walks over to her and again flashes a warm,
			sympathetic smile.

							GITTES
					How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?

							MRS. MULWRAY
					Mr. Gittes...

							GITTES
					Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to
					be the problem?

			She holds her breath. The revelation isn't easy for her.

							MRS. MULWRAY
					My husband, I believe, is seeing
					another woman.

			Gittes looks mildly shocked. He turns for confirmation
			to his two partners.

							GITTES
						(gravely)
					No, really?

							MRS. MULWRAY
					I'm afraid so.

							GITTES
					I am sorry.

		10   Gittes pulls up a chair sitting next to Mrs. Mulwray --
			between Duffy and Walsh. Duffy cracks his gum.

			Gittes gives him an irritated glance.
			Duffy stops chewing.

							MRS. MULWRAY
					Can't we talk about this alone,
					Mr. Gittes?

							GITTES
					I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray.
					These men are my operatives and
					at some point they're going to
					assist me. I can't do everything
					myself.

							MRS. MULWRAY
					Of course not.

							GITTES
					Now -- what makes you certain he
					is involved with someone?

			Mrs. Mulwray hesitates. She seems uncommonly nervous 
			at the question.

							MRS. MULWRAY
					-- a wife can tell.

			Gittes sighs.

							GITTES
					Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your
					husband?

							MRS. MULWRAY 
						(shocked)
					... Yes of course.

							GITTES
						(deliberately)
					Then go home and forget about it.

							MRS. MULWRAY
					-- but...

							GITTES
						(staring intently at
						her)
					I'm sure he loves you, too. You
					know the expression, let sleeping
					dogs lie? You're better off not
					knowing.

							MRS. MULWRAY
						(with some real
						anxiety)
					But I have to know.

			Her intensity is genuine. Gittes looks to his two 
			partners.

							GITTES
					All right, what's your husband's
					first name?

							MRS. MULWRAY
					Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.

							GITTES
						(visibly surprised)
					-- Water and Power?

			Mrs. Mulwray nods, almost shyly. Gittes is now casually
			but carefully checking out the detailing of Mrs. 
			Mulwray's dress -- her handbag, shoes, etc.

							MRS. MULWRAY
					-- he's the Chief Engineer.

							DUFFY
						(a little eagerly)
					-- Chief Engineer?

		11   Gittes' glance tells Duffy Gittes wants to do the 
			questioning. Mrs. Mulwray nods.

							GITTES
						(confidentially)
					This type of investigation can
					be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs.
					Mulwray. It takes time.

							MRS. MULWRAY
					Money doesn't matter to me, Mr.
					Gittes.

			Gittes sighs.

							GITTES
					Very well. We'll see what we
					can do.

		12   EXT. CITY HALL - MORNING

			already shimmering with heat.

			A drunk blows his nose with his fingers into the fountain
			at the foot of the steps.

			Gittes, impeccably dressed, passes the drunk on the way
			up the stairs.

		13   INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS

			Former Mayor SAM BAGBY is speaking. Behind him is a huge
			map, with overleafs and bold lettering:

				"PROPOSED ALTO VALLEJO DAM AND RESERVOIR"

			Some of the councilmen are reading funny papers and 
			gossip columns while Bagby is speaking.

							BAGBY
					-- Gentlemen, today you can walk
					out that door, turn right, hop on
					a streetcar and in twenty-five
					minutes end up smack in the Pacific
					Ocean. Now you can swim in it, you
					can fish in it, you can sail in
					it - but you can't drink it, you
					can't water your lawns with it,
					you can't irrigate an orange grove
					with it. Remember -- we live next
					door to the ocean but we also live
					on the edge of the desert. Los
					Angeles is a desert community.
					Beneath this building, beneath
					every street there's a desert.
					Without water the dust will rise
					up and cover us as though we'd
					never existed!
						(pausing, letting
						the implication
						sink in)

		14   CLOSE - GITTES

			sitting next to some grubby farmers, bored. He yawns --
			edges away from one of the dirtier farmers.

							BAGBY(O.S.)
						(continuing)
					The Alto Vallejo can save us from
					that, and I respectfully suggest
					that eight and a half million
					dollars is a fair price to pay to
					keep the desert from our streets
					-- and not on top of them.

		15   AUDIENCE - COUNCIL CHAMBERS

			An amalgam of farmers, businessmen, and city employees
			have been listening with keen interest. A couple of the
			farmers applaud. Somebody shooshes them.

		16   COUNCIL COMMITTEE

			in a whispered conference.

							COUNCILMAN
						(acknowledging Bagby)
					-- Mayor Bagby... let's hear from
					the departments again -- I suppose
					we better take Water and Power
					first. Mr. Mulwray.

		17   REACTION - GITTES

			looking up with interest from his racing form.

		18   MULWRAY

			walks to the huge map with overleafs. He is a slender
			man in his sixties, who wears glasses and moves with
			surprising fluidity. He turns to a smaller, younger
			man, and nods. The man turns the overleaf on the map.

							MULWRAY
					In case you've forgotten, gentlemen,
					over five hundred lives were lost
					when the Van der Lip Dam gave way
					-- core samples have shown that
					beneath this bedrock is shale
					similar to the permeable shale
					in the Van der Lip disaster.
					It couldn't withstand that kind

						(referring to a new

					Now you propose yet another dirt
					banked terminus dam with slopes
					of two and one half to one, one
					hundred twelve feet high and a
					twelve thousand acre water surface.
					Well, it won't hold. I won't
					build it. It's that simple -- I
					am not making that kind of mistake
					twice. Thank you, gentlemen.

			Mulwray leaves the overleaf board and sits down. Suddenly
			there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the
			chambers and a red-faced FARMER drives in several
			scrawny, bleating sheep. Naturally, they cause 
			a commotion.

							COUNCIL PRESIDENT
						(shouting to farmer)
					What in the hell do you think you're
					doing?
						(as the sheep bleat
						down the aisles
						toward the Council)
					Get those goddam things out of here!

							FARMER
						(right back)
					Tell me where to take them! You don't
					have an answer for that so quick, do
					you?

		19   Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms respond to the
			imprecations of the Council and attempt to capture 
			the sheep and the farmers, having to restrain one who
			looks like he's going to bodily attack Mulwray.

							FARMER
						(through above, to
						Mulwray)
					-- You steal the water from the
					valley, ruin the grazing, starve
					my livestock -- who's paying you
					to do that, .Mr. Mulwray, that's
					what I want to know!

		22   L.A. RIVERBED - LONG SHOT

			It's virtually empty. Sun blazes off it's ugly concrete
			banks. Where the banks are earthen, they are parched
			and choked with weeds.

			After a moment, Mulwray's car pulls INTO VIEW on a flood
			control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed.
			Mulwray gets out of the car. Me looks around.

		23   WITH GITTES

			holding a pair of binoculars, downstream and just above
			the flood control road -- using some dried mustard weeds
			for cover. he watches while Mulwray makes his way
			down to the center of the riverbed.

			There Mulwray stops, tuns slowly, appears to be looking
			at the bottom of the riverbed, or -- at nothing at all.

		24   GITTES

			trains the binoculars on him. Sun glints off Mulwray's
			glasses.

		25   BELOW GITTES
			There's the SOUND of something like champagne corks 
			popping. Then a small Mexican boy atop a swayback horse 
			rides it into the riverbed, and into Gitte's view.

		26   MULWRAY

			himself stops, stands still when he hears the sound.
			Power lines and the sun are overhead, the trickle of
			brackish water at his feet.

			He moves swiftly downstream in the direction of the
			sound, toward Gittes.

		27   GITTES

			moves a little further back as Mulwray rounds the bend
			in the river and comes face to face with the Mexican
			boy on the muddy banks. Mulwray says something to the boy.

			The boy doesn't answer at first. Mulwray points to the
			ground. The boy gestures. Mulwray frowns. He kneels
			down in the mud and stares at it. He seems to be
			concentrating on it.

		28   After a moment, he rises, thanks the boy and heads swiftly
			back upstream -- scrambling up the bank to his car.

			There he reaches through the window and pulls out a roll
			of blueprints or something like them - he spreads them
			on the hood of his car and begins to scribble some notes,
			looking downstream from time to time.

			The power lines overhead HUM.

			He stops, listens to them -- then rolls up the plans and 
			gets back in the car. He drives off.

		29   GITTES

			Hurries to get back to his car. He gets in and gets right 
			back out. The steamy leather burns him. He takes a 
			towel from the back seat and carefully places it on the 
			front one. He gets in and takes off.

		30   OMITTED

		31   POINT FERMIN PARK - DUSK

			Street lights go on.

		32   MULWRAY

			pulls up, parks. Hurries out of the car, across the park 
			lawn and into the shade of some trees and buildings.

		33   GITTES

			pulls up, moves across the park at a different angle, but 
			in the direction Mulwray had gone. He makes it through 
			the trees in time to see Mulwray scramble adroitly down 
			the side of the cliff to the beach below. Be seems in 
			a hurry. Gittes moves after him - having a little more 
			difficulty negotiating the climb than Mulwray did.

		34   DOWN ON THE BEACH

			Gittes looks to his right - where the bay is a long,
			clear crescent. He looks to his left - there's a 
			promontory of sorts. It's apparent Mulwray has gone 
			that way. Gittes hesitates, then moves in that direction 
			-- but climbs along the promontory in order to be 
			above Mulwray.

		35   AT THE OUTFALL

			Gittes spots Mulwray just below him, kicking at the sand.

			Mulwray picks up a starfish. Brushes the sand off it.
			Looks absently up toward Gittes.

		36   GITTES

			backs away, sits near the outfall, yawns.

		37   BEACON LIGHT AT POINT FERMIN

			flashing in the dust.

		38   CLOSE - GITTES

			sitting, suddenly starts. He swears softly -- he's in
			a puddle of water and the seat of his trousers is wet.

		39   MULWRAY

			below him in watching the water trickling down from 
			the outfall near Gittes.

			Mulwray stands and stares at the water, apparently 
			fascinated. Even as Gittes watches Mulwray watching, the 
			volume and velocity seem to increase until it gushes in 
			spurts, cascading into the sea, whipping it into a foam.

		40	AT THE STREET - GITTES' CAR

			There's a slip of paper stuck under the windshield wiper. 
			Gittes pulls it off, gets in the car and turns on the 
			dash light. It says: "SAVE OUR CITY! LOS ANGELES IS 
			DYING OF THIRST! PROTECT YOUR PROPERTY! LOS ANGELES
			IS YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE!!! VOTE YES NOVEMBER
			6......CITIZENS COMMITTEE TO SAVE OUR CITY, HON. SAM 
			BAGBY, FORMER MAYOR - CHAIRMAN." Gittes grumbles, 
			crumples it up and tosses it out the window. He notices
			other flyers parked on a couple of cars down the street.

			Gittes reaches down and opens his glove compartment.

		41   INT. GLOVE COMPARTMENT

			consists of a small mountain of Ingersoll pocket watches.

			The cheap price tags are still on them. Gittes pulls 
			out one.

			He absently winds it, checks the time with his own watch. 
			It's 9:37 as he walks to .Mulwray's car and places it 
			behind the front wheel of Mulwray's car. He yawns again 
			and heads back to his own car.

		42   GITTES

			arrives whistling, opens the door with "J.J. GITTES AND 
			ASSOCIATES - DISCREET INVESTIGATION" on it.

							GITTES 
					Morning, Sophie.

			Sophie hands him a small pile of messages. He goes 
			through them.

							GITTES
					Walsh here?

							SOPHIE 
					He's in the dark room.

		43   Gittes walks through his office to Duffy and Walsh's.
			A little red light is on in the corner, over a closed 
			door. Gittes walks over and knocks on the door.

							GITTES 
					Where'd he go yesterday?

							WALSH'S VOICE 
					Three reservoirs -- Men's room of 
					a Richfield gas station on Flower, 
					and the Pig 'n Whistle.

							GITTES
					Jesus Christ, this guy's really 
					got water on the brain.

							WALSH'S VOICE
					What'd you expect? That's his job.

							GITTES
					Listen, we can't string this broad 
					out indefinitely -- we got to come 
					up with something.

							WALSH'S VOICE 
					I think I got something.

							GITTES
					Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?

		44   INT. DUFFY & WALSH'S OFFICE - GITTES

							WALSH'S VOICE
					It's on your desk. Say, you hear 
					the one about the guy who goes to 
					the North Pole with Admiral Byrd 
					looking for penguins?

			Gittes walks to his office.

		45   ON HIS DESK

			is the Ingersoll watch, the crystal broken -- the hands 
			stopped at 2:47.

							GITTES 
					He was there all night.

			Gittes drops it, sits down. Walsh comes in carrying a 
			series of wet photos stuck with clothes pins onto a small 
			blackboard.

							GITTES
						(continuing; eagerly) 
					So what you got?

			Walsh shows him the photos. He looks at them. They are 
			a series outside a restaurant showing Mulwray with 
			another man whose appearance is striking. In two 
			of the photos a gnarled cane is visible.

							GITTES 
						(continuing; obviously
						annoyed)
					This?

							WALSH
					They got into a terrific argument 
					outside the Pig 'n Whistle.

							GITTES
					What about?

							WALSH
					I don't know -- the traffic was 
					pretty loud. I only heard one 
					thing -- apple core.

							GITTES
					Apple core?

							WALSH
						(shrugs)
					Yeah.

		46   INT. GITTES' OFFICE

			Gittes tosses down the photos in disgust.

							GITTES
					Jesus Christ, Walsh -- that's what 
					you spent your day doing?

							WALSH
					Look, you tell me to take pictures, 
					I take pictures.

							GITTES
					Let me explain something to you, 
					Walsh -- this business requires 
					a certain finesse --

			The PHONE has been RINGING. Sophie buzzes him.

							GITTES
					Yeah, Sophie?
						(he picks up the phone)
					Duffy, where are you?

			Duffy's VOICE can be HEARD, excitedly -- "I got it. I 
			got it. He's found himself some cute little twist -
			in a rowboat, in Echo Park."

							GITTES 
						(continuing)
					Okay, slow down -- Echo Park --
						(to Walsh)
					Jesus, water again.

		47   WESTLAKE PARK (McARTHUR PARK)

			Duffy is rowing, Gittes seated in the stern.

			They pass Mulwray and a slender blonde girl in a summer 
			print dress, drifting in their rowboat, Mulwray fondly 
			doting on the girl.

							GITTES
						(to Duffy, as they
						pass)
					Let's have a big smile, pal.

			He shoots past Duffy, expertly running off a couple of 
			fast shots. Mulwray and the girl seem blissfully 
			unaware of them.

		48   DUFFY

			turns again and they row past Mulwray and the girl,
			Gittes again clicking off several fast shots.

		49   CLOSE SHOT - SIGN:

						"EL MACANDO APARTMENTS"

			MOVE ALONG the red tiled roof and down to a lower level 
			of the roof where Gittes' feet are hooked over the apex 
			of the roof and Gittes himself is stretched face downward 
			on the tiles, pointing himself and his camera to a 
			veranda below him where the girl and Mulwray are eating. 
			Gittes is clicking off more shots when the tiles his 
			feet are hooked over come loose.

			Gittes begins a slow slide down the tile to the edge of 
			the roof -- and possibly over it to a three-story drop. 
			He tries to slow himself down. The loose tile also 
			begins to slide.

			Gittes stops himself at the roof's edge by the storm 
			drain and begins a very precarious turn - this time 
			hooking his feet in the drain itself. The loose tile 
			falls and hits the veranda below. He stops as it's about
			to slide over the edge. He carefully lays it in the
			drain. But a fragment off the cracked edge of the tile
			falls.

		50   WITH MULWRAY AND THE GIRL

			Mulwray staring at the fragment at his feet. He looks 
			to the girl. He's clearly concerned. He rises, looks up 
			to the roof.

		51   FROM HIS POV

			The roof and the sign topping it betray nothing. He 
			slowly sits back down, staring at the tile fragment.

		52   CLOSE SHOT - NEWSPAPER

			DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER BLOWS FUSE OVER CHIEF'S 
			USE OF FUNDS FOR EL MACANDO LOVE NEST.

			In the style of the Hearst yellow press, there is a 
			heart-shaped drawing around one of the photos that 
			Gittes had taken. Next to it is a smaller column, 
			"J.J. Gittes hired by suspicious spouse."

		53   INT. BARBERSHOP - GITTES

			holds the paper and reads while getting his haircut and 
			his shoes shined. In fact, almost all the customers 
			are reading papers.

							BARNEY
						(to Gittes)
					-- when you get so much publicity, 
					after a while you must get blasé
					about it.

			A self-satisfied smile comes to Gittes' face.

							BARNEY 
						(continuing) 
					Face it. You're practically 
					a movie star.

			In b.g., customers can be 0VERHEARD talking about the 
			drought. Interspersed with above, someone is saying, 
			"They're gonna start rationing water unless it rains." 
			Someone else says, "Only for washing your cars." Third 
			says, "You're not going to be able to water your lawn 
			either, or take a bath more than once a week." First 
			says, "If you don't have a lawn or a car, do you get an 
			extra bath?"

		54   Gittes has been staring outside the barbershop. A car 
			is stalled. The hood is up. A man watches his 
			radiator boiling over.

							GITTES 
						(laughing)

					Look at that.

							BARNEY
					Heat's murder.

							OTHER CUSTOMER
						(end of conversation) 
					Fools names and fools faces...

		55   Gittes has heard the word. He straightens up.

						GITTES 
					(smiling; to Other
						Customer)
					What's that, pal?

							OTHER CUSTOMER 
						(indicating paper) 
					Nothing -- you got a hell of a 
					way to make a living.

							GITTES
					-- Oh? What do. you do to make 
					ends meet?

							OTHER CUSTOMER 
					Mortgage Department, First National Bank.

			Gittes laughs.

							GITTES
					Tell me, how many people a week 
					do you foreclose on?

							OTHER CUSTOMER
					We don't publish a record in the 
					paper, I can tell you that.

							GITTES
					Neither do I.

							OTHER CUSTOMER
					No, you have a press agent do it.

			Gittes gets out of the chair. Barney, a little concerned, 
			tries to restrain him, holding onto the barber sheet 
			around Gittes' neck.

							GITTES 
					Barney, who is this bimbo? He a
					regular customer?

							BARNEY 
					Take it easy, Jake.

							GITTES
					Look, pal -- I make an honest 
					living. People don't come to 
					me unless they're miserable and
					I help 'em out of a bad situation. 
					I don't kick them out of their 
					homes like you jerks who work in 
					the bank.

							BARNEY 
					Jake, for Christ's sake.

		56   Gittes is trying to take off his sheet.

							GITTES
					C'mon, get out of the barber chair. 
					We'll go outside and talk this 
					over --

			The Customer is shrinking back into the chair.

							BARNEY
					Hey, c'mon, Jake. Sit down. Sit 
					down -- you hear about the fella 
					goes to his friend and says, 
					'What'll I do, I'm tired of 
					screwing my-wife?' and his 
					friend says, 'Whyn't you do 
					what the Chinese do?'
		
			Gittes allows himself to be tugged back to his chair.

							GITTES
					I don't know how that got in the
					paper as a matter of fact - it
					surprised me it was so quick.
					I make an honest living.

							BARNEY
					'Course you do, Jake.

							GITTES 
					An honest living.

							BARNEY 
						(continuing) 
					So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you 
					do what the Chinese do?'

		57   INT. GITTES' OFFICE

			Gittes comes bursting in, slapping a newspapers on his 
			thigh.

							GITTES
					Duffy, Walsh --

			Walsh comes out of his office, Duffy out of the other
			one.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					Sophie -- go to the little girl's
					room for a minute.

							SOPHIE 
					But, Mr. Gittes --


							GITTES 
						(insisting)
					Sophie.

							SOPHIE 
					Yes, Mr. Gittes.

			She gets up and leaves.

							GITTES
					-- so there's this fella who's 
					tired of screwing his wife --

							DUFFY
					Jake, listen -

							GITTES
					Shut up, Duffy, you're always in 
					a hurry - and his friend says why 
					not do what-the Chinese do? So he 
					says what do they do? His friend 
					says the Chinese they screw for a 
					while -- just listen a second, 
					Duffy --

			A stunning YOUNG WOMAN appears behind Gittes in his 
			doorway. She's shortly joined by a small, GRAY-HAIRED
			MAN. They listen, unseen by Gittes.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					-- and then they stop and they 
					read a little Confucius and they 
					screw some more and they stop and 
					they smoke some opium and then 
					they go back and screw some more 
					and they stop again and they 
					contemplate the moon or something 
					and it makes it more exciting. 
					So this other guy goes home to 
					screw his wife and after a while 
					he stops and gets up and goes into 
					the other room only he reads Life 
					Magazine and he goes back and he 
					screws some more and suddenly says 
					excuse me a second and he gets up 
					and smokes a cigarette and he goes 
					back and by this time his wife is 
					getting sore as hell. So he screws 
					some more and then he gets up to look 
					at the moon and his wife says, 'What 
					the hell do you think you're doing?
					(Gittes breaks up)
					... you're screwing like a Chinaman.'

		58   Gittes hangs onto Sophie's desk laughing his ass off. 
			The little Gray-Haired Man winces. When Gittes looks 
			up he sees the Young Woman, apparently in her late 
			twenties. She's so stunning that Gittes nearly gasps.

							YOUNG WOMAN
					Mr. Gittes?

							GITTES
					Yes?

							YOUNG WOMAN
					Do you know me?

							GITTES
					-- well -- I think I -- I 
					would've remembered.

							YOUNG WOMAN 
					Have we ever met?

							GITTES
					Well, no.

							YOUNG WOMAN
					Never?

							GITTES
					Never.

							YOUNG WOMAN
					That's what I thought. You see, 
					I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray -- you 
					know, Mr. Mulwray's wife.

		59   Gittes is staggered. He glances down at the newspaper.

							GITTES
					Not that Mulwray?

							EVELYN
					Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And 
					since you agree with me we've never 
					met, you must also agree that I 
					haven't hired you to do anything -
					certainly not spy on my husband.
					I see you like publicity, Mr. 
					Gittes. Well, you're going to 
					get it -

							GITTES
					Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...

			She's walked past him toward the door. He stop her.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					-- there's some misunderstanding 
					here. It's not going to do any 
					good to get tough with me --

			Evelyn flashes a cold smile.

							EVELYN
					I don't get tough with anybody, 
					Mr. Gittes. My lawyer does.

			Evelyn starts out the door and Gittes starts after her. 
			This time he's stopped by the Gray-Haired Man who has 
			also come out of his office and up behind him.

							GRAY-HAIRED MAN 
					Here's something for you, Mr. 
					Gittes --

			Gittes turns to be handed a thick sheaf of papers, a 
			summons and complaint. Evelyn walks out the door.

							GRAY-HAIRED MAN
						(continuing;
						pleasantly)
					I suppose we'll be hearing from 
					your attorney.

			Gittes stares down at the papers in his hand.

		60   INT. GITTES' INNER OFFICE - GITTES, DUFFY & WALSH

			On Gittes' desk. there are empty coffee cups, the summons 
			and complaint -- and the newspaper Gittes had brought 
			with him from the barber shop.

			The three men are sitting, worn and silent. Walsh 
			chewing gum is the loudest noise in the room.

			Gittes looks to Walsh with obvious irritation. Walsh
			stops chewing.

			Duffy puts out a cigarette in the dregs of one of the 
			coffee cups.

							GITTES
						(to Duffy)
					There's seven ashtrays in this 
					room, Duffy.

							DUFFY
					Okay.

							GITTES 
					That's a filthy habit.

							DUFFY 
					I said okay,. Jake.

							GITTES
					Yeah, yeah -- if she'd come in 
					here saying she was Shirley Temple 
					you'd say okay to that, too.

							WALSH
					Look, Jake -- she gave us Mulwray's
					real phone number and address --

							GITTES
					All she needed for that was the 
					phone book!

							WALSH
					No, no -- she said not to call, 
					her husband might answer.

							GITTES
					-- when I find out who that phony 
					bitch was --

			Gittes is staring down at the newspaper. He suddenly 
			grabs the phone, begins dialing. A tight little smile 
			breaks out on his face. He buzzes Sophie.

							GITTES
					Sophie.

							SOPHIE 
					Yes, Mr. Gittes.

							GITTES
					Get me the Times -- Whitey
					Mehrholtz --
						(as he waits)
					And how about that snotty broad?
						(the phone to his
						ear)
					What does she think, she's perfect? 
					Coming in waving her lawyers and 
					her money at me -- so goddam smug. 
					She's no better than anybody else 
					in this town --

			Sophie BUZZES.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					Whitey, what's new, pal?... Yeah, 
					listen, where did you get those 
					photographs... Yeah, blowing a 
					fuse over the El Macando love 
					nest -- that's cute, Whitey... 
					so who sent them to you... I 
					sent them?
						(Gittes laughs a
						little hysterically)
					Why would I be asking how you got 
					them if I sent them?... Whitey?... 
					Whitey?... C'mon, level with me 
					for once, my tit's in the wringer 
					and it's beginning to hurt... 
					yeah... yeah -- yeah.

			He hangs up.

					So he says you sent them?

		62   INT. DEPARTMENT WATER & POWER - HALL 

			Gittes stops outside a door marked:

						HOLLIS J. MULWRAY
						CHIEF ENGINEER

		63   He enters an outer office. The SECRETARY looks surprised.

							GITTES
					Mr. Mulwray, please.

							SECRETARY
					He's not in, Mr. -

							GITTES
					Gittes.

							SECRETARY
					May I ask what this is regarding?

							GITTES
					It's personal. Has he been out long?

							SECRETARY
					Since lunch.

							GITTES
					Gee whiz --
						(he glances at his
						watch)
					-- and I'm late.

							SECRETARY 
					He was expecting you?

							GITTES 
					Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't 
					I go in and wait?

			Without waiting for a response, he does. The Secretary 
			half rises in protest but Gittes is through the inner 
			door.

		64   MULWRAY'S INNER OFFICE

			The walls are covered with commendation, photos of 
			Mulwray at various construction sites, large maps of 
			watershed areas and reservoirs in the city. On the 
			desk is a framed, tinted photo of Evelyn in riding 
			clothes.

			Gittes moves to the desk, watching the translucent pane 
			in the upper half of the door leading to the outer 
			office as he does.

			He begins to open and close. the desk drawers after 
			quickly examining the top. He tries one of the drawers 
			and it doesn't open. He reopens the top drawer, and 
			the bottom one opens.

			He looks in it, pulls out a checkbook. He opens it --
			riffles through the stubs like he was shuffling cards. 
			Drops it -- finds a set of keys, an old phone book, and 
			a menu from a Water Department lunch at the Biltmore 
			Hotel in 1913. Then, Gittes hauls out the blueprints 
			that Mulwray had laid across the hood of his car --
			they read in bold type: WATERSHED AND DRAINAGE SYSTEM 
			FOR THE LOS ANGELES BASIN.

			He flips through them -- reads one notation in Mulwray's 
			neat hand: "Tues. night. Oak Pass Res. - 7 channels 
			used."

			Gittes spots a shadow looming in front of the translucent 
			pane. He quickly tosses item after item back, kneeing 
			the drawer -- nearly knocking a spare pair of Mulwray's 
			glasses off the desk top when he does. He catches them, 
			puts them on the desk and is pacing the room as the 
			door opens.

		65   RUSS YELBURTON

			enters the room. An anxious Secretary is right behind 
			him.

							YELBURTON
					Can I help you?
						(extending his hand)
					Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in 
					the Department.

							GITTES
						(equally pleasant) 
					J.J. Gittes -- and it's not a 
					departmental matter.
	
							YELBURTON
					I wonder if you'd care to wait 
					in my office?

			This is more a request than an invitation. Gittes nods, 
			follows Yelburton out, through the outer office to his 
			offices down the hall.

							YELBURTON 
						(continuing; as
						they're going)
					You see -- this whole business 
					in the paper with Mr. Mulwray 
					has us all on edge --

		66   INT. YELBURTON OFFICE

			Smaller than Mulwray's, he has most noticeably a 
			lacquered marlin mounted on the wall. There are a couple
			of other pictures of Yelburton with yellowtail and other
			fish he's standing beside.

			There's also a small burgee of a fish with the initials 
			A.C. below it, tacked onto the wall.

							YELBURTON
					After all, you work with a man 
					for a certain length of time, 
					you come to know him, his habits, 
					his values, and so forth -- well 
					either he's the kind who chases 
					after women or he isn't.

							GITTES 
					And Mulwray isn't?

							YELBURTON
					He never even kids about it.

							GITTES
					Maybe he takes it very seriously.

		67   Gittes winks. Yelburton chuckles appreciatively,
			loosening up a little.

							GITTES
					You don't happen to know where
					Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?

							YELBURTON
					I'm sorry, I --

							GITTES
					Well, tell him I'll be back.

			Gittes spots a card tray on Yelburton's desk.

							GITTES 
						(continuing)
					-- Mind if I take one of your 
					cards? In case I want to get 
					in touch with you again.

							YELBURTON
					Help yourself.

		68   Gittes fishes a couple off the tray, puts them in his 
			handkerchief pocket. He goes out the door, nearly running 
			into a man who is standing by the Secretary's desk -
			about GITTES' age only a head taller and a foot wider, 
			dressed in a plain suit that fits him about as well as 
			a brown paper bag.

							GITTES 
					Mulvihlll, what are you doing 
					here?

		69   OUTER OFFICE - YELBURTON, MULVIHILL AND GITTES

			MULVIHILL stares at Gittes with unblinking eyes, remains 
			by the desk.

							MULVIHILL
					They shut my water off, what's 
					it to you?

							GITTES
					How'd you find out? You don't 
					drink it, you don't take a bath 
					in it, maybe they sent you a 
					letter. Ah, but then you'd have 
					to be able to read.

			Mulvihill moves toward Gittes, shaking with fury. 
			Yelburton steps between them.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.
						(to Yelburton)
					Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?

							YELBURTON
					Hope so. He's working for us.

		70   OMMITTED

		71   GITTES

			turns off onto a winding road. It goes up into the
			foothills.

			Gittes swerves, missing a dog stretched out lazily in
			the road. Gittes honks and yells indignantly at the
			sleepy animal.

		72   Gittes stops on a curve. Above a steep bank and partially
			hidden is the Mulwray home -- designed and constructed
			with shade and curves that are dramatic. When he turns
			off the ignition, the distant SOUND of the SURF can be
			HEARD.

			Gittes heads up to the entrance.

		73   EXT. MULWRAY HOUSE - GITTES

			rings the bell. He waits.

			A powerful CHINESE BUTLER with heavy hair and a half-
			jacket of gold on one front tooth, answers the door.

							GITTES
					J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.

			He hands the Chinese Butler a card from his wallet. The 
			Butler takes it and disappears, leaving Gittes standing 
			in the doorway.

			Gittes stands, and sweats, watching a Japanese GARDENER 
			trim a hedge. There's a SQUEAKING SOUND. Gittes moves 
			a few feet off the porch.

		74   POV - GARAGE

			A chauffeur is washing down a cream-colored Packard with 
			a chamois. Steam rises off the hood. The squeaking has 
			obviously come from the chamois.

		75   CHINESE BUTLER
			in doorway.

							CHINESE BUTLER
					Please.

			Gittes looks behind him. The Chinese Butler is gesturing 
			for him to follow.

		76   THROUGH THE HOUSE - GITTES

			follows him, trying to check out the rooms as he goes. 
			A maid is cleaning in the den. They pass through it out 
			some French doors along a trellised walkway to a large 
			pond with running water.

							CHINESE BUTLER 
					You wait, please.

		77   Gittes is left standing by the pond. It's suddenly very 
			quiet except for the runnning water. The pond is over-
			flowing. After a moment, the Gardener comes running back.
			He smiles at Gittes, probes into the pond.

			There's something gleaming in the bottom of it. Gittes 
			notes it. After a moment, the Gardener drops the long 
			probe -- the waters recede.

		78   EXT. POND - GITTES AND JAPANESE GARDENER - DAY

							GARDENER
							(to Gittes) 
					Bad for glass.

							GITTES
							(not understanding) 
					Yeah sure. Bad for glass.

			The Gardener nods, and is off, leaving Gittes staring at 
			the object in the bottom of the pond that is gleaming.

			He looks at the tool the Gardener was using, hesitates, 
			picks .it up and starts to probe into the pond himself, 
			toward the gleaming object.

			He then spots Evelyn rounding a turn, coming down the
			trellised pathway. He casually belts the probe, holds
			onto it for poise.

			Evelyn is wearing jeans that are lathered white on the 
			inside of the thighs and laced with brown horsehair.

			She's wearing riding boots, is perspiring a little, but 
			looks younger than she did in the office.

							EVELYN
					Yes, Mr. Gittes?

			Gittes is a little taken aback at seeing Evelyn. He is 
			annoyed as well. Nevertheless, he is elaborately polite.

							GITTES
					Actually, I'm here to see your
					husband, Mrs. Mulwray.

			He laughs. a little nervously. He waits for a reply.
			There is none. The Chinese Butler appears on the veranda.

							EVELYN
					Would you like something to drink?

							GITTES 
					What are you having?

							EVELYN
					Iced tea.

							GITTES 
					Yeah -- fine, thank you.

			Chinese Butler nods, disappears

		79   EXT. POND AND GARDEN - MULWRAY HOUSE - DAY

			Evelyn sits at a glass-topped table. Gittes Joins her.

							EVELYN
					My husband's at the office.

							GITTES
					Actually he's not. And he's moved 
					from his apartment at the El Macando.

							EVELYN 
						(sharply)
					That's not his apartment.

							GITTES
					Anyway I -- the point is, Mrs. 
					Mulwray, I'm not in business to
					be loved, but I am in business, 
					and believe me, whoever set up 
					your husband, set me up. L.A.'s 
					a small town, people talk --

			He waits for a response. Then:

							GITTES
						(continuing;
						uneasily)
					I'm just trying to make a living, 
					and I don't want to become a 
					local Joke -

							EVELYN
					Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into 
					it. I'll drop the lawsuit.

							GITTES
					What ?

							EVELYN
					I said I'll drop it.

			The iced tea comes on a tray which Ramon sets down 
			between them.

							EVELYN
						(continuing;
						pleasantly)
					-- so let's just -- drop the 
					whole thing. Sugar? Lemon --

							GITTES
					Mrs. Mulwray?

							EVELYN
						(as she's mixing
						one of the drinks) 
					-- Yes, Mr. Gittes?

							GITTES
					I don't want to drop it.

		80   Evelyn looks up. Gittes smiles a little sheepishly.

							GITTES
					I should talk this over with your 
					husband.

							EVELYN
						(a little concerned) 
					Why?... What on earth for? 
					Look, Hollis seems to think 
					you're an innocent man.

							GITTES
					Well, I've been accused of many 
					things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never 
					that.

			Again he laughs a little nervously. Again no reaction.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					You see, somebody went to a lot
					of trouble here, and I want to
					find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit.
					I'm not the one who's supposed to
					be caught with my pants down...
					so I'd like to see your husband --
					unless that's a problem.

							EVELYN
						(with a slight edge) 
					What do you mean?

							GITTES
					May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?

							EVELYN
					You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.

							GITTES
						(determined to be
						polite)
					-- Well, that little girlfriend, 
					she was attractive -- in a cheap 
					sort of way of course -- she's 
					disappeared. Maybe they disappeared 
					together somewhere.

							EVELYN
						(with rising anger) 
					Suppose they did. How does it 
					concern you?

							GITTES
					-- Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, 
					I just --

							EVELYN
					It's very personal. It couldn't 
					be more personal. Is this a 
					business or an obsession with you?

							GITTES
					Look at it this way -- Now this 
					phony broad, excuse the language, 
					says she's you, she's hired me. 
					Whoever put her up to it, didn't 
					have anything against me. They 
					were out to get your husband. 
					Now if I see him, I can help him 
					did you talk this morning?

		81   Evelyn brushes lightly at the horsehair on her Jeans.

							EVELYN
					-- No. I went riding rather early --

							GITTES
					-- Looks Like you went quite a 
					distance --

							EVELYN
					No, Just riding bareback, that's 
					all. Anyway, you might try the
					Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs 
					-- sometimes at lunch Hollis takes 
					walks around them -- otherwise he'll 
					be home by 6:30.

							GITTES
					I'll stop by.

							EVELYN 
					Please call first.

			Gittes nods.

		82   EXT. OAK PASS RESERVOIR - DAY

			Gittes drives up a winding road, following a flood 
			channel up into the parched hills.

		83   TWO FIRE TRUCKS

			one a rescue truck, are at the entrance to the reservoir.

			The chain link fence with its KEEP OUT sign is open and 
			there are people milling around. The reservoir is below.

			Gittes' car is stopped by a couple of UNIFORMED POLICE.

							GUARD
					Sorry, this is closed to the 
					public, sir.

			Gittes hesitates only a moment, then:

							GITTES
						(to the Guard)
					It's all right -- Russ Yelburton, 
					Deputy Chief in the Department.

			He fishes out one of Yelburton's cards from his 
			handkerchief pocket -- hands it to the Guard.

							GUARD 
					Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.

		84   Gittes drives past the Guards, through the gate, along 
			the reservoir. He spots a police car and an unmarked
			one as well.

			Gittes stops and gets out of the car. Several men with 
			their backs turned, one talking quietly, staring down 
			into the reservoir where other men in small skiffs are 
			apparently dredging for something.

			One of the men turns and sees Gittes. He recognizes
			Gittes and is visibly shocked.

							LOACH
					Gittes -- for Chrissakes --

							GITTES
					Loach --

							LOACH
						(moving to Gittes,
						taking him by the
						arm)
					-- C'mon, get out of here before --

		85   EXT. RESERVOIR - DAY

			Loach tries to ease him down the path.

							GITTES
					Before what? What the hell's
					going on?

			At the sound of his raised voice, a man standing at the 
			edge of the channel, talking to two boys in swimming 
			trunks, turns around. He's a tall, sleek Mexican in 
			his early thirties, LUIS ESC0BAR.

			Both Gittes and Escobar register considerable surprise 
			at seeing one another. The men around them are extremely 
			uneasy.

			Loach is actually sweating. Finally, Escobar smiles.

							ESCOBAR 
					Hello, Jake.

							GITTES
						(without smiling)
					How are you, Lou?

							ESCOBAR
					-- I have a cold I can't seem to 
					shake but other than that, I'm 
					fine.

							GITTES 
					Summer colds are the worst.

							ESCOBAR 
					Yeah, they are.

			Gittes reaches into his pocket, pulls out his cigarette
			case.

							A FIREMAN
					No smoking, sir -- it's a fire 
					hazard this time of year --

							ESCOBAR
					I think we can make an exception 
					-- I'll see he's careful with the 
					matches.

							GITTES
						(lighting up) 
					Thanks, Lou.

							ESCOBAR
					How'd you get past the guards?

							GITTES
					Well, to tell you the truth, I 
					lied a little.

		86   Escobar nods. They walk a couple of steps -- the other 
			police -- two plainclothesmen and a uniformed officer 
			watch them.

							ESCOBAR
					You've done well by yourself.

							GITTES
					I get by.

							ESCOBAR
					Well, sometimes it takes a while 
					for a man to find himself and I 
					guess you have.

							LOACH
					Poking around in other people's 
					dirty linen.

							GITTES
					Yeah. Tell me. You still throw 
					Chinamen into jail for spitting 
					on the laundry?

							ESCOBAR
					You're behind the times, Jake --
					they've got steam irons now --
						(smiles)
					And I'm out of Chinatown.

							GITTES
					Since when?

							ESCOBAR
					Since I made Lieutenant --

			It's apparent Gittes is impressed despite himself.

							GITTES 
					Congratulations.

							ESCOBAR
					Uh-huh -- so what are you doing 
					here?

							GITTES 
					Looking for someone.

							ESCOBAR
					Who?

							GITTES
					Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?

							ESCOBAR
					Oh yes.

							GITTES 
					I'd like to talk to him.

							ESCOBAR 
					You're welcome to try. There he is.
		
		87   Escobar points down to the reservoir -- a couple of men 
			using poles with hooks are fishing about in the water. 
			It can be SEEN that one of them has hooked something.

			He shouts. The other man hooks it, too. They pull, 
			revealing the soaking back of a man's coat -- they start 
			to pull the body into the skiff.

		88   INT. CORONER'S OFFICE - EVELYN AND ESCOBAR

			are standing over the body of Mulwray. Escobar has the 
			sheet drawn back. Evelyn nods.

			Escobar drops the sheet. Escobar and Evelyn move a 
			few feet to one side and whisper, almost as though they 
			were trying to keep the corpse from hearing them.

							ESCOBAR
					-- It looks like he was washed 
					the entire length of the runoff 
					channel -- could he swim?

							EVELYN
					Of course.

							ESCOBAR
					-- Obviously the fall must have 
					knocked him out --

			Evelyn nods slightly Escobar coughs. A coroner's 
			assistant wheels the body out of the office.

							ESCOBAR 
						(continuing)
					-- This alleged affair he was 
					having -- the publicity didn't 
					make him morose or unhappy?

		89   OUTSIDE THE CORONER'S

			Gittes has been sitting on a wooden bench, smoking and 
			listening. At this question, he rises and looks through 
			the doorway.

		9O   Escobar sees him, ignores him. Evelyn doesn't see him.

							EVELYN
					... Well, it didn't make him 
					happy...

							ESCOBAR
					But there is no possibility he 
					would have taken his own life?

							EVELYN 
						(sharply)
					No.

							ESCOBAR
						(a little uncomfortably
						now)
					Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know
					the name of the young woman in
					question?

			Evelyn shows a flash of annoyance.

							EVELYN
					No.

							ESCOBAR
					Do you know where she might be?

							EVELYN
					Certainly not!

			Escobar and Evelyn move slowly toward the door.

							ESCOBAR
					You and your husband never
					discussed her?

							EVELYN.
						(stopping, faltering)
					He... we did... he wouldn't tell
					me her name. We quarreled over
					her... of course -- it came as a
					complete surprise to me --

							ESCOBAR
					A complete surprise?

							EVELYN
					-- Yes.

							ESCOBAR
					But I thought you'd hired a
					private investigator --

							EVELYN
					A private investigator?

							ESCOBAR
						(gesturing vaguely
						toward the door)
					Mr. Gittes.

							EVELYN
					Well yes --

		91   Evelyn looks up to see Gittes standing in the doorway
			only a foot or two from her. She stops cold. They look
			at one another for a long moment.

							EVELYN
						(her eyes on Gittes)
					But I... I... did that because
					I thought it was a nasty rumor I'd
					put an end to...

			She finishes, looks plaintively at Gittes. Escobar is 
			right at her back. Gittes says nothing.

							ESCOBAR
					-- And when did Mr. Gittes inform
					you that these rumors had some
					foundation in fact?

			Evelyn looks at Escobar but doesn't know how to answer him.

							GITTES
						(smoothly)
					-- Just before the story broke in
					the papers, Lou.

		92   Escobar nods. They begin to walk slowly, again have to
			move out of the way as some other corpse is being wheeled
			out of one of the Coroner cubicles.

							ESCOBAR
					-- You wouldn't happen to know
					the present whereabouts of the
					young woman.

							GITTES
					-- No.

							ESCOBAR
					Or her name?

							GITTES
					-- No.

			They have walked a few steps further down the hall.

							EVELYN
					Will you need me for anything
					else, Lieutenant?

							ESCOBAR
					I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray.
					Of course you have my deepest
					sympathy -- and -- if we need
					anymore information, we'll be
					in touch.

							GITTES
					I'll walk her to her car, be
					right back.

		93   ESCOBAR'S POV

			Evelyn glances at Gittes. They go through a couple of
			outer doors and pass several reporters who have been
			in the outer hall, laughing, kidding, the tag end of
			lines like "only in L.A." and "Southern Cafeteria."

			Gittes hurries her past the reporters who flank them,
			asking questions. Gittes brushes them aside.

		94   EVELYN AND GITTES - AT HER CAR

			in a small parking lot.

			Evelyn fumbles in her bag, looking feverishly for some-
			thing in her purse.

							GITTES
					Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.

							EVELYN
						(flushed, perspiring)
					... Just a minute...

							GITTES
					(touching her gently)
					-- You left your keys in the ignition.

							EVELYN
					Oh... thank you.

			She glances down, leans against the side of the car.

							EVELYN
						(continuing)
					Thank you for going along with
					me. I just didn't want to explain
					anything... I'll send you a check.

							GITTES
						(puzzled)
					A check?

			Evelyn gets in her car.

							EVELYN
					To make it official, I hired you.

			She drives off, leaving Gittes gaping.

		95   INT. CORONER'S OFFICE HALLWAY

							GITTES
					Don't give me that, Lou. You
					hauled me down here for a statement.

			Escobar shrugs.

							ESCOBAR
					I don't want it anymore.

							GITTES
					No?

							ESCOBAR
					No -- it was an accident.

							GITTES
					You mean that's what you're going
					to call it.

			Escobar looks up.

							ESCOBAR
					That's right.
						(contemptuously)
					Out of respect for his civic 
					position.

			Resume walking.

			Gittes laughs.

							GITTES
					What'd he do, Lou, make a pass
					at your sister?

			Escobar stops.

							ESCOBAR
					No -- he drowned a cousin of mine
					with about five hundred other
					people. But -- they weren't
					very important, Just a bunch of
					dumb Mexicans living by a dam.
					Now beat it, Gittes, you don't
					come out of this smelling like
					a rose, you know.

							GITTES
					Oh yeah? Can you think of
					something to charge me with?

							ESCOBAR
					When I do, you'll hear about it.

			Gittes nods, turns, and walks down the hall.

		96   OUTSIDE MORGUE

			Gittes stops by a body on the table, the toe tagged with
			Mulwray's name. MORTY is standing near it in a doorway
			to an adjoining room. A RADIO is on, and with it the
			announcement that they're about to hear another chapter
			in the life of Lorenzo Jones and his devoted wife, Belle.
			Another Coroner's assistant sits at the table, listening
			to the radio and eating a sandwich.

		97   Gittes ambles into the room.

							MORTY
						(a cigarette dangling
						out of his mouth)
					Jake, what're you doin' here?

							GITTES
					Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch
					hour, I thought I'd drop by and
					see who died lately.

			Gittes picks up the sheet and pulls it back. CAMERA
			GETS ITS FIRST GLIMPSE of Mulwray's body -- eyes open,
			the face badly cut and bruised.

							MORTY
					Yeah? Ain't that something?
					Middle of a drought, the water
					commissioner drowns -- only in L.A.

							GITTES
						(looking at. Mulwray)
					-- Yeah -- banged up pretty bad --

							MORTY
					-- That's a long fall.
		
							GITTES
					-- So how are you, Morty?

			Morty is wheeling in another body with the help of an
			assistant.

							MORTY
					-- Never better. You know me, Jake.

			As he begins to move the body into the refrigerator, he
			breaks into a wrenching spasm of coughing. Gittes spots
			the other body, lowers the. sheet on Mulwray.

							GITTES
						(picking up on cough)
					-- Yeah -- so who you got there?

			Morty pulls back the sheet.

							MORTY
					Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk --
					used to hang around Ferguson's
					Alley --

			Morty brushes some sand from the man's face, laughs.

							MORTY
						(continuing)
					-- Quite a character. Lately he'd
					been living in one of the downtown
					storm drains -- had a bureau dresser
					down there and everything.

		98   Gittes has already lost interest. He starts away.

							GITTES
					-- Yeah.

							MORTY
					Drowned, too.

			This stops Gittes.

							GITTES
					Come again?

							MORTY
					Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out
					in the bottom of the riverbed.

							GITTES
					The L.A. River?

							MORTY
						(a little puzzled)
					Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge,
					what's wrong with that?

			Gittes has moved back to the body, looks at it more
			closely.

							GITTES
					It's bone dry, Morty.

							MORTY
					It's not completely dry.

							GITTES
					Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown
					in a damp riverbed either, I don't
					care how soused he was. That's
					like drowning in a teaspoon.

			Morty shrugs.

							MORTY
					We got water out of him, Jake.
					He drowned.

			Gittes walks away mumbling.

							GITTES
					Jesus, this town...

		99   EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - GITTES - DAY

			He's parked on an overpass -- the sign HOLLENBECK BRIDGE
			on one of its concrete columns. Gittes looks down into
			the riverbed below.

		100  FROM THE BRIDGE

			Gittes can see the muddy remains of a collapsed shack,
			its contents strewn down river from the bridge. Below
			him, lying half over the storm drain and one wall that
			was on the bank of the river is a sign that proclaims
			OWN YOUR OWN OFFICE IN THIS BUILDING $5000 to $6000
			which was used as a roof of sorts. Downstream, there's
			the dresser, an oil drum, a Ford seat cushion, an Armour
			lard can, etc. -- the trashy remains of Shuhardt's home.

		101  Gittes scrambles down the embankment and as he lands near
			the storm drain one shoe sinks, ankle deep into mud.
			Gittes pulls it out, swearing.

			He begins to walk a little further downstream when he
			hears the vaguely familiar SQUISHY CLOP of something.

			Clearing the bridge. on the opposite side is the little
			Mexican Boy, again on his swayback horse, riding along
			the muddy bank.

			They look at one another a moment.

							GITTES
						(calling out to him)
					You were riding here the other
					day, weren't you...?

			The Boy doesn't answer.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					Speak English?... Habla Ingles?

							THE BOY
						(finally)
					Si.

							GITTES
					Didn't you talk to a man here
					-- few days ago... wore glasses
					... he...

			The Boy nods.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					What did you talk about, mind
					my asking?

			The shadows of the two are very long now.

							THE BOY
						(finally)
					The water.

							GITTES
					What about the water?

							THE BOY
					-- when it comes.

							GITTES
					-- When it comes? What'd you
					tell him?

							THE BOY
					Comes in different parts of the
					river -- every night a different
					part.

			Gittes nods. The horse snorts. The Boy rides slowly on.

		102  EXT. RIVEBED - DUSK

			Gittes scrambles up the embankment to note the direction
			the storm drain by Hollenbeck Bridge takes. It is headed
			above toward the Hollywood Hills, where the sun is
			setting.

		103  EXT. GITTES IN CAR - NIGHTFALL

			winding his way up a section of the Hollywood Hills. He
			picks up on an open flood channel with the spotlight by
			the driver's windwing.

		104  GITTES IN CAR- MOVING

			along the flood channel. It is dark now and Gittes follows 
			the channel with the car spotlight. He turns at a fork 
			in the road which allows him to continue following the 
			flood channel.

		105  FURTHER UP - MOVING

			The road is narrower. Gittes drives more slowly. Foliage
			is overgrown in the channel so its bottom cannot be
			glimpsed.

		106  STILL FURTHER - NIGHT
			The road is dirt. Heavy clusters of oak trees and 
			eucalyptus are everywhere. It is very still. Another 
			turn and a pie-shaped view of a lake of lights in the 
			city below can be GLIMPSED.

		107  POV - CHAIN-LINK FENCE

			over the road, bolted. It says OAK PASS RESERVOIR.
			KEEP OUT. NO TRESPASSING.

			The chain-link itself actually extends over the flood
			channel and down into it, making access along the
			channel itself impossible.

		108  Gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, the
			spotlight. A lone light overhead on tension wires is the
			sole illumination. There is only the eerie SOUND of the
			tension WIRES HUMMING.

			Gittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the
			Flood channel itself.

		109  ON THE OTHER SIDE

			Gittes carefully works his way up through the thick
			Foliage toward a second and large chain-link fence.
			Lights from the reservoir still higher above can be SEEN.

			Suddenly there is a GUNSHOT. Then ANOTHER. Gittes dives
			into the flood control channel, which is at this point
			about four feet deep and six feet wide. There is the
			SOUND of men scurrying through the brush, coming near
			him, then retreating. Gittes loses himself among the
			ivy in the channel.

			He waits. The men seem to have passed him by. But there
			is another SOUND now -- an echoing growing sound. It 
			puzzles Gittes. He starts to lift his head to catch 
			the direction.

		110  GITTES IN FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL - NIGHT

			Then he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over
			him, knocks off his hat, carries him down the channel,
			banging into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab
			some of the overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out.
			But the force of the stream batters him and carries him
			with it until he's brought rudely to the chain-link 
			fence. It stops him cold. He's nearly strained through 
			it.

			Swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing
			water by means of the fence itself.

			Drenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence
			and makes his way toward his car.

		111  AT GITTES' CAR

			He fishes for his car keys, looks down -- one shoe is
			missing.

							GITTES
						(grumbling)
					Goddam Florsheim shoe, goddammit.

			He starts to get into his car but Mulvihill and a SMALLER
			MAN stop him -- Mulvihill pulling his coat down and 
			pinning his arms -- holding him tightly. The smaller man
			thrusts a switchblade knife about an inch and a half up
			Gittes' left nostril.

							SMALLER MAN
						(shaking with emotion)
					Hold it there, kitty cat.

		112  CLOSE - GITTES

			frozen, the knife in his nostril, the street lamp over-
			head gleaming on the silvery blade.

							THE SMALLER MAN
					You are a very nosey fellow, kitty
					cat... you know what happens to
					nosey fellows?

			The Smaller Man actually seems to be trembling with rage
			when he says this. Gittes doesn't move.

							SMALLER MAN
						(continuing)
					Wanna guess? No? Okay.
					lose their noses.

			With a quick flick the Smaller Man pulls back on the
			blade, laying Gittes' left nostril open about an inch
			further. Gittes screams. Blood gushes down onto his shirt
			and coat.

			Gittes bends over, instinctively trying to keep the blood
			from getting on his clothes. Mulvihill and the Smaller
			Man stare at him.

							THE SMALLER MAN
						(continuing)
					Next time you lose the whole thing,
					kitty cat. I'll cut it off and
					feed it to my goldfish, understand?

							MULVIHILL
					Tell him you understand, Gittes.

		113  EXT. OAK PASS RESERVOIR - NIGHT

			Gittes is now groveling on his hands and knees.

							GITTES
						(mumbling)
					I understand...

			Gittes on the ground can see only his tormentor's two-
			tone brown and white wing-tipped shoes -- lightly
			freckled with his blood.

		114  THE SHOE

			comes up and lightly shoves Gittes into the ground.
			the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS RETREATING, Gittes gasping.

		115  INT. GITTES' OFFICE - GITTES

			sits behind his desk, BACK TO CAMERA, not moving. Duffy
			sits staring at nothing, Walsh moves uneasily around the
			room.

			The PHONE is RINGING. Sophie BUZZES.
		
							GITTES
						(pressing down
						intercom)
					Yeah, Sophie.

							SOPHIE'S VOICE
					A Miss Sessions calling.

							GITTES
					Who?

							SOPHIE'S VOICE
					Ida Sessions.

							GITTES
					Don't know her -- take a number.

		116  NEW ANGLE - REVEALING

			a bandage spread-eagled across Gittes' nose.

							WALSH
					So some contractor wants to
					build a dam and he makes a
					few payoffs. So what?

			Gittes turns slowly to Walsh. He lightly taps his nose.

							WALSH
					(	continuing)
					Think you can nail Mulvihill?
					They'll claim you were trespassing.

							GITTES
					I don't want Mulvihill. I. want the
					big boys that are making the payoffs.

							DUFFY
					Then what'll you do?

							GITTES
					Sue the shit out of 'em.

							WALSH 
					Yeah?

							GITTES
					Yeah -- what's wrong with you
					guys? Think ahead. We find 'em,
					sue 'em -- we'll make a killing.
						(a dazzling smile)
					We'll have dinner at Chasen's
					twice a week, we'll be pissing
					on ice the rest of our lives.

							WALSH
					Sue people like that they're
					liable to be having dinner with
					the Judge who's trying the suit.

			Gittes looks irritated. The PHONE RINGS again.

							SOPHIE'S VOICE
					Miss Ida Sessions again. She says
					you know her.

							GITTES
					Okay.

		117  Gittes picks up the phone. He winks to his boys.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't
					believe we've had the pleasure.

							IDA'S VOICE
					-- Oh yes we have... are you
					alone, Mr. Gittes?

							GITTES
						(clowning a little
						for the boys)
					Isn't everybody? What can I do
					for you, Miss Sessions?

			Walsh promptly starts to tell Duffy the Admiral Byrd
			story.

							IDA'S VOICE
					Well, I'm a working girl, Mr.
					Gittes -- I didn't come in to see
					you on my own.

							GITTES
					-- When did you come in?
		
							IDA'S VOICE
					-- I was the one who pretended to
					be Mrs. Mulwray, remember?

		ll8  Walsh has finished off the punch line and both men are
			laughing raucously. Gittes drops the mail he's been
			loafing through and puts his hand over the receiver.

							GITTES 
						(to Duffy and Walsh)
					Shut the fuck up!
						(then back to Ida)
					... Yes I remember -- nothing,
					Miss Sessions, just going over
					a detail or two with my associates
					... you were saying?

							IDA'S VOICE
					Well I never expected anything
					to happen like what happened to
					Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it
					ever comes out I want somebody
					to know I didn't know what would
					happen.

							GITTES
					-- I understand... if you could
					tell me who employed you, Miss
					Sessions -- that could help us
					both --

							IDA'S VOICE
					Oh no --

							GITTES
					... Why don't you give me your
					address and we can talk this over?

							IDA'S VOICE
					No, Mr. Gittes -- just look in
					the obituary column of today's
					Times...

							GITTES
					The obituary column?

							IDA'S VOICE
					You'll find one of those people --

							GITTES
					'Those people?' Miss Sessions --

			She hangs up. Gittes looks to his two men.

		119  OMITTED

		120  INT. BROWN DERBY - CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER

			Gittes is seated, flips through the paper until he finds
			the OBITUARY COLUMN -- scans it, looks up -- abruptly
			tears the column from the paper and puts it in his
			pocket.

			When he closes the paper we can SEE headlines in the
			left hand column: WATER BOND ISSUE PASSES COUNCIL.
			Ten million dollar referendum to go before the public.

			Evelyn Mulwray is standing at the table as he does so.
			He rises, allows her to sit.

		121  CLOSE ON EVELYN

			Gittes watches her as she removes her gloves slowly...
			She's wearing dove gray gabardine -- subdued, tailored.

							GITTES
					Thanks for coming... drink?

			The waiter's appeared. Evelyn is looking at Gittes' nose.

							EVELYN
					Tom Collins -- with lime, not
					lemon, please.

			Evelyn looks down and smoothes her gloves. When she
			looks back up she stares expectantly at Gittes.

			Gittes pulls out a torn envelope. The initials ECM can
			be SEEN in a delicate scroll on the comer of it.

							GITTES
					I got your check in the mall.

							EVELYN
					Yes. As I said, I was very
					grateful.

			Gittes' fingers the envelope. He coughs.

							GITTES
					Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's
					not good enough.

					EVELYN
						(a little embarrassed)
					Well, how much would you like?

		121  CLOSE ON EVELYN

							GITTES
					Stop it. The money's fine. It's
					generous but you've shortchanged
					me on the story.

							EVELYN
						(coolly)
					I have?

							GITTES
					I think so. Something besides
					your husband's death was bothering
					you. You were upset but not that
					upset.

							EVELYN
					Mr. Gittes...
						(icily)
					Don't tell me how I feel.

			The drinks come. The waiter sets them down.

							GITTES
					Sorry. Look, you sue me, your
					husband dies, you drop the
					lawsuit like a hot potato, and
					all of it quicker than wind from
					a duck's ass -- excuse me. Then
					you ask me to lie to the police.

							EVELYN
					It wasn't much of a lie.

							GITTES
					-- If your husband was killed it
					was.
						(meaning check)
					-- This can look like you paid
					me off to withhold evidence.

							EVELYN
					But he wasn't killed.

			Gittes smiles.

							GITTES
					I think you're hiding something,
					Mrs. Mulwray.

		122  Evelyn remains unperturbed.

							EVELYN
					-- Well, I suppose I am...
					actually I knew about the affair.

							GITTES
					How did you find out?

							EVELYN
					My husband.

							GITTES
					He told you?

			Evelyn nods.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					-- And you weren't the slightest
					bit upset about it?

							EVELYN
					-- I was grateful.

			Evelyn for the first time appears a little embarrassed.

							GITTES
					You'll have to explain that,
					Mrs. Mulwray.

							EVELYN
					-- Why?

							GITTES
						(a flash of
						annoyance)
					Look, I do matrimonial work, It's
					my metiay. When a wife tells me
					she's happy her husband is cheating
					on her it runs contrary to my
					experience.

			Gittes looks significantly to Evelyn.

							EVELYN
					Unless what?

							GITTES
						(looking directly
						at her)
					She's cheating on him.

		122  Evelyn doesn't reply.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					-- Were you?

		123  Evelyn is clearly angry but she is controlling it.

							EVELYN
					I don't like the word 'cheat.'

							GITTES
					Did you have affairs?

							EVELYN
						(flashing)
					Mr. Gittes --

							GITTES
					Did he know?

							EVELYN
						(almost an outburst)
					Well I wouldn't run home and tell
					him whenever I went to bed with
					someone, if that's what you mean.

			This subdues Gittes a little. Evelyn is still a little
			heated.

							EVELYN
						(continuing; more
						calmly)
					-- Is there anything else you
					want to know?

							GITTES
					Where you were when your husband
					died.

							EVELYN
					I can't tell you.

							GITTES
					You mean you don't know where
					you were?

							EVELYN
					I mean I can't tell you.

							GITTES
					-- You were seeing someone, too.

		124  Evelyn looks squarely at him. She doesn't deny it.

							GITTES
					-- For very long?

							EVELYN
					I don't see anyone for very long,
					Mr. Gittes. It's difficult for
					me. Now I think you know all
					you need to about me. I didn't
					want publicity. I didn't want
					to go into any of this, then or
					now. Is this all?

			Gittes nods.

							GITTES
					Oh, by the way. What's the 'C'
					stand for?

			He's been fingering the envelope. .

							EVELYN
						(she stammers
						slightly)
					K... Cross.

							GITTES
					That your maiden name?

							EVELYN
					Yes... why?

							GITTES
					No reason.

			Evelyn turns into Gittes.

							EVELYN
					You must've had a reason to ask
					me that.

							GITTES
						(shrugs)
					No. I'm just a snoop.

							EVELYN
					You seem to have had a reason
					for every other question.

							GITTES
					No, not for that one.

							EVELYN
					I don't believe you.

			Gittes suddenly turns sharply in to Evelyn.

							GITTES
						(moving in)
					Do me a favor. Sit still and
					act like I'm charming.

			Evelyn involuntarily draws back.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					There's somebody here. Say
					something. Anything. Something
					like we're being intimate.

		125  Evelyn reluctantly allows Gittes to move closer and
			dangle his hand in front of their faces. She stares
			at him.

							EVELYN
						(meaning his nose)
					How did it happen?

							GITTES
						(quietly)
					Been meaning to talk to you
					about that.

							EVELYN
						(quietly)
					Maybe putting your nose in other
					people's business?

							GITTES
						(quietly)
					More like other people putting
					their business in my nose.

			Evelyn actually smiles a little.

							WOMAN'S VOICE
					You son of a bitch.

			Gittes looks up and flashes his smile.

							GITTES
					Mrs. Match. How're you?

			Mrs. MATCH is swaying over the table, a plump woman with
			a glass of whiskey in one hand, a large purse in the
			other, and a menacing look in her eye.

							MRS. MATCH
					Don't give me that, you son of
					a bitch.

							GITTES
					Okay.

			Gittes turns back to Evelyn.

							EVELYN
						(softly)
					Another satisfied client?

							GITTES
					Another satisfied client's wife.

							MRS. MATCH
					Look at me, you son of a bitch.
					You... you bastard. Are you
					happy, are you happy now?

		126  She tries to take a swipe at Gittes with her purse.
			Gittes covers himself. Waiters rush over.

							MRS. MATCH
					-- You smug son of a bitch. My
					husband's so upset he sweats all
					night! How do you think that makes
					me feel?

							GITTES
					Sweaty?

			Mrs. Match swings at Gittes again and again. She catches
			him on the nose. It hurts. He covers it -- then swings
			his leg out from under the table and deftly kicks her
			in the shin.

			Mrs. Match drops her purse and spills her drink. She
			grabs her shin, hopping around a little. The waiters
			who had tried to restrain her now try to keep her from
			falling over.

							GITTES
					Let's get out of here before she
					picks up her purse.

			They rise and move toward the door.

							EVELYN
						(quietly)
					Tough guy, huh?

			Gittes looks, sees she's kidding, and nods.

		127  OUTSIDE IN THE PARKING LOT - DUSK

			Gittes' car has been .brought by the parking attendant.
			The attendant opens the passenger side for Evelyn.

							EVELYN
					Oh, no. I've got my own car.
					The cream-colored Packard.

							GITTES
						(to attendant who
						dutifully starts
						for her car)
					Wait a minute, sonny.
						(to Evelyn)
					I think you better come with me.

							EVELYN
					What for? There's nothing more
					to say.
						(to attendant)
					Get my car, please.

			The attendant starts after it again. Gittes leans on
			the open door of his car and in to Evelyn. He talks
			quietly but spits it out.

							GITTES
					Okay, go home. But in case
					you're interested your husband
					was murdered. Somebody's dumping
					tons of water out of the city
					reservoirs when we're supposedly
					in the middle of a drought, he
					found out, and he was killed.
					There's a waterlogged drunk in
					the morgue -- involuntary manslaughter
					if anybody wants to take the trouble
					which they don't. it looks like half
					the city is trying to cover it all
					up, which is fine with me. But,
					Mrs. Mulwray --
						(now inches from her)
					-- I goddam near lost my nose!
					And I like it. I like breathing
					through it. And I still think
					you're hiding something.

			Evelyn steadies herself on the open car door. She stares
			at Gittes for a long moment. Then he gently tugs the
			car door closed.

							EVELYN
					Mr. Gittes --

			He drives off into the Wilshire traffic, leaving Evelyn
			looking after him.

		128  INT.. DWP - MULWRAY'S OFFICE DOOR

			with its lettering:

						HOLLIS I. MULWRAY
						CHIEF ENGINEER

			Gittes goes through the door to the Secretary. She looks
			up. She recognizes Gittes again and is not happy to see
			him.

							GITTES
					J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton.

			The Secretary immediately gets up and goes into the inner
			office.

			Gittes turns and strolls around the office a moment --
			he sees a photographic display of THE HISTORY OF THE DWP
			- THE EARLY YEARS, along the wall. He stops as he spots
			a photo of the man with the cane Gittes had seen photos
			of earlier -- He is standing high in the mountains, near
			a pass. The caption reads JULIAN CROSS - 1905. Cross
			is strikingly handsome.

			Gittes immediately pulls out the envelope containing
			Evelyn's check. He looks at the corner of it, his
			thumb pressing down under the middle initial C, then
			he looks back to the photos --

			The Secretary returns.

							SECRETARY
					Mr. Yelburton will be busy for
					some time.

							GITTES
					Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll 
					wait.

							SECRETARY
					He's liable to be tied up
					indefinitely.

							GITTES
					I take a long lunch. All day
					sometimes.

			Gittes pulls out a cigarette case, offers the Secretary
			one. She refuses, He lights up and begins to hum 'The
			Way You Look Tonight,' strolling along the wall looking
			at more photographs.

		129  INT. MULWRAY'S OFFICES

			Here he spots several photos of a much younger Mulwray,
			along with Julian Cross. One of the captions: HOLLIS
			MULWRAY AND JULIAN CROSS AS THE AQUEDUCT CLEARS THE
			SANTA SUSANNAH PASS - 1912. Gittes, still humming,
			turns to the Secretary.

							GITTES
					Julian Cross worked for the water
					department?

							SECRETARY
						(looking up)
					Yes. No.

							GITTES
						(humming, then)
					He did or he didn't?

							SECRETARY
					He owned it.

			Gittes is genuinely surprised. at this.

							GITTES
					He owned the water department?

							SECRETARY
					Yes.

							GITTES
					He owned the entire water supply
					for the city?

							SECRETARY
					Yes.

							GITTES
						(really surprised)
					How did they get it away from him?

							SECRETARY
						(a sigh, then)
					Mr. Mulwray felt the public should
					own the display -- the water. If
					you'll just read the display --

							GITTES
						(glances back, hums,
						then)
					Mulwray? I thought you said
					Cross owned the department.

							SECRETARY
					-- Along with Mr. Mulwray.

							GITTES
					They were partners.

							SECRETARY
						(testily)
					Yes. Yes, they were partners.

			She gets up, annoyed, and goes into Yelburton's inner
			office.

			Gittes goes back to the photographs. He hears a 
			SCRATCHING SOUND, apparently coming from just outside the
			outer door.

			He moves quickly to it, hesitates -- swiftly opens the
			door. workmen are behind it, scraping away Mulwray's
			name on the outer door -- looking up at Gittes in some
			surprise.

			The Secretary returns, sees the workman on the floor.

							SECRETARY
						(to Gittes)
					Mr. Yelburton will see you now.

			Gittes nods graciously, heads on into Yelburton's office.

		130  INT. DWP - YELBURTON & GITTES

			There is a subtle but perceptible difference in 
			Yelburton's attitude. He's now head of the department.

							YELBURTON
					Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you
					waiting -- these staff meetings,
					they just go on and on --

							GITTES
					Yeah -- must be especially tough
					to take over under these
					circumstances.

							YELBURTON
					Oh yes. Hollis was the best
					department head the city's ever
					had. My goodness, what happened
					to your nose?

							GITTES
						(smiles)
					I cut myself shaving.

							YELBURTON
					You ought to be more careful.
					That must really smart.

							GITTES
					Only when I breathe.

							YELBURTON
						(laughing)
					Only when you breathe... don't tell
					me you're still working for
					Mrs. Mulwray?

							GITTES
					I never was.

							YELBURTON
					(stops smiling)
					I don't understand.

							GITTES
					Neither do I, actually. But you
					hired me -- or you hired that chippie
					to hire me.

							YELBURTON
					Mr. Gittes, you're not making a
					bit of sense.

							GITTES
					Well, look at it this way, Mr.
					Yelburton. Mulwray didn't want
					to build a dam -- and he had a
					reputation that was hard to get
					around, so. you decided to ruin it.
					Then he found out that you were
					dumping water every night -- then
					he -- was drowned.

							YELBURTON
					Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous
					accusation. I don't know what
					you're talking about.

							GITTES
					Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at
					the Times will. Dumping thousands
					of gallons of water down the toilet
					in the middle of a drought -- that's
					news.

		131  Gittes heads toward the door.

							YELBURTON
					Wait -- please sit down, Mr. Gittes.
					We're... well, we're not anxious
					for this to get around, but we have
					been diverting a little water
					to irrigate avocado and walnut
					groves in the northwest
					valley. As you know, the farmers
					there have no legal right to our
					water, and since the drought we've
					had to cut them off -- the city
					comes first, naturally. But,
					well, we've been trying to help
					some of them out, keep them from
					going under. Naturally when you
					divert water -- you get a little
					runoff.

							GITTES
					Yeah, a little runoff. Where are
					those orchards?

							YELBURTON
					I said, the northwest valley.

							GITTES
					That's like saying they're in
					Arizona.

							YELBURTON
					Mr. Gittes, my field men are out
					and I can't give you an exact
					location...

			Gittes nods.

							GITTES
					You're a married man, am I right?

							YELBURTON
					Yes... 

							GITTES
					Hard working, have a wife and kids...

							YELBURTON
					Yes...

							GITTES
					I don't want to nail you -- I
					Just want to know who put you up
					to it. I'll give you a few days
					to think it over --
						(hands him a card)
					-- call me. I can help. Who knows?
					Maybe we can lay the whole thing off
					on a few big shots -- and you can
					stay head of the department for
					the next twenty years.

			Gittes smiles -- leaves an unsmiling Yelburton.

		132  INT. GITTES OFFICE

			Gittes enters, drops his hat on Sophie's desk. Sophie
			tries to tell him something but Gittes goes on into his
			office.

		133  EVELYN MULWRAY

			is sitting, smoking. She looks up when he enters.

							EVELYN
					What's your usual salary?

			Gittes moves to his desk, barely breaking stride at the
			sight of her.

							GITTES
					Thirty-five bucks daily for me,
					twenty for each of my operators --
					plus expenses, plus my fee if I
					show results.

			He's sitting now. Evelyn is very pale now, obviously
			very shaken.

							EVELYN
					Whoever's behind my husband's
					death, why have they gone to all
					this trouble?

							GITTES
					-- Money. How they plan to make
					it by emptying the reservoirs --
					that I don't know.

							EVELYN
					I'll pay your salary plus five
					thousand dollars if you find out
					what happened to Hollis and who
					is involved.

			Gittes buzzes Sophie.

							GITTES
					Sophie, draw up one of our
					standard forms for Mrs. Mulwray.
						(he leans back; to
						Evelyn)
					Tell me, did you get married
					before or after Mulwray and your
					father sold the water department?

			Evelyn nearly jumps at the question.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					Your father is Julian Cross, isn't
					he?

							EVELYN
					Yes, of course -- it was quite a
					while after. I was just out of
					grade school when they did that.

							GITTES
					-- so you married your father's
					business partner?

			Evelyn nods. She lights another cigarette.

							GITTES
						(continuing; staring
						at her, points to
						the ashtray)
					You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.

							EVELYN
					-- Oh. 

		134  She quickly stubs one out.

							GITTES
					Is there something upsetting about
					my asking about your father?

							EVELYN
					No!... yes, a little. You see
					Hollis and my fa -- my father had
					a falling out...

							GITTES
					Over the water department -- or
					over you?

							EVELYN
						(quickly)
					Not over me. Why would they have
					a falling out over me?

							GITTES
						(noting her
						nervousness)
					-- Then it was over the water
					department.

							EVELYN
					Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes.
					Yes and no. Hollis felt the public
					should own the water but I don't
					think -- my father felt that way.
					Actually, it was over the Van der
					Lip. The dam that broke.

							GITTES
					-- Oh, yeah?

							EVELYN
					Yes. He never forgave him for it.

							GITTES
					Never forgave him for what?

							EVELYN
					For talking him into building it,
					he never forgave my father... They
					haven't spoken to this day.

							GITTES
						(starts a little)
					You sure shout that?

							EVELYN
					Of course I'm sure.

							GITTES
					What about you -- do you and your
					father get along?

		135  Sophie comes in with the form, cutting off Evelyn's
			reply. Gittes places two copies on a coffee table in
			front of Evelyn.

							GITTES
					Sign here... The other copy's for
					you.

			She signs it. When she looks back up, Gittes is staring
			intently at her.

							EVELYN
					What are you thinking?

							GITTES
						(picking up one of
						copies, folding it,
						putting it in his
						pocket)
					Before this -- I turned on the
					faucet, it came out hot and cold,
					I didn't think there was a thing
					to it.

		136  INT. SEAPLANE

			The engines make the small cabin vibrate. Gittes threads
			his way down the tiny aisle of the eight passenger cabin,
			which is full of middle-aged men in old clothes and
			their fishing gear. Gittes is poked by a pole -- has to
			move along.

			One of the old men says something to him.

							GITTES
						(above the engines)
					What?

							OLD MAN
					You'll have to sit with the pilot.

			Gittes moves forward into the cockpit, the PILOT looks
			up -- nods for Gittes to sit down, first moving a half-
			eaten cheese sandwich out of Gittes' seat.

		137  EXT. HARBOR- SEAPLANE

			taxiing down the ramp into the sea. In a moment, it
			kicks up a spray of foam and takes off.

		138  INT. COCKPIT

			The island gradually looming larger before the Pilot and
			Gittes.

			The Pilot glances over at Gittes -- who, as usual, is
			impeccably dressed -- a contrast to the others on the
			plane.

							PILOT
						(above the engines)
					Well, you're not going fishing.

			Gittes shakes his head.

							GITTES
					Not exactly.

							PILOT
						(winks)
					But that's what you told your
					wife ---

			The Pilot laughs raucously. Gittes laughs politely.

							PILOT
					-- lots of fellas do. Tell the
					little woman they're going on a
					fishing trip, then shack up with
					some little twist on the island
					... she pretty?

							GITTES
						(abruptly)
					I'm going to see a man called
					Julian Cross -- ever heard of him?

							PILOT
					Is the Pope Catholic? Who are
					you, mister?... I ask because he
					doesn't see a whole lot of people.

							GITTES
					I'm working for his daughter.

							PILOT
						(surprised)
					That right?... She used to be
					some looker.

							GITTES
					She ain't exactly long in the
					tooth now.

							PILOT
					She must be about thirty-three,
					thirty-four.

							GITTES
					You must be thinking of a different
					daughter --

							PILOT
					No, he's only got one, I remember
					her age, I read it in the newspapers
					when she ran away.

							GITTES
					She ran away?

							PILOT
					Oh yeah, it was a big thing at
					the time -- Julian Cross' daughter.
					God almighty. She was a wild
					little thing.

		139  He gives a sidelong glance to Gittes, a little concerned
			he's said too much.

							PILOT
						(continuing)
					Course, she settled down nicely.

							GITTES
						(smiling a little)
					Well, you never know, do you?

							PILOT
						(loosening up)
					That's for sure.

							GITTES
					Why'd she run away?

							PILOT
					Oh, you know -- she was sixteen
					or seventeen.

							GITTES
						(nudging him)
					We missed the best of it, didn't
					we, pal?

			Both men laugh a little lewdly.

							PILOT
					She ran off to Mexico -- rumor was
					she was knocked up and didn't even
					know who the father was -- went
					there to get rid of it.

							GITTES
					You don't say?

							PILOT
					Cross was looking for her all
					over the country -- offered rewards,
					everything. Felt real sorry for
					him, with all his money.

		140  ALBACORE CLUB - DAY

			A pleasant but unobtrusive clapboard blue and white
			building on the bay overlooking the harbor. The sea-
			plane lands. A motor launch with a burgee of a fish
			flying from it turns and heads in the direction of the
			plane.

		141  EXT. WINDING ROAD - RANCHO DEL CRUCE

			Gittes, driven in a station wagon, passes under the sign
			with a cross painted below the name.

			The ranch itself is only partially in a valley on the
			island -- as the wagon continues one can SEE that it is
			actually a miniature California, encompassing desert,
			mountains and canyon that tumble down palisades to the
			windward side of the sea.

			The wagon comes to a halt where a group of hands are
			clustered around a corral. The circle of men drift
			apart, leaving JULIAN CROSS standing, using a cane for
			support, reedy but handsome in a rough linen shirt and
			jeans. When he talks his strong face is lively, in repose
			it looks ravaged.

		142  EXT. BRIDLE PATH - GITTES & CROSS

			walking toward the main house -- a classic Monterey. A
			horse led on a halter by another ranch hand slows down
			and defecates in the center of the path they are taking.
			Gittes doesn't notice.

							CROSS
					Horseshit.

			Gittes pauses, not certain he has heard correctly.

							GITTES
					Sir?

							CROSS
					I said horseshit.
					(pointing)
					Horseshit.

							GITTES
					Yes, sir, that's what it looks
					like -- I'll give you that.

		143  Cross pauses when they reach the dung pile. He removes
			his hat and waves it, inhales deeply.

							CROSS
					Love the smell of it. A lot of
					people do but of course they
					won't admit it. Look at the
					shape.

			Gittes glances down out of politeness.

							CROSS
						(continuing; smiling,
						almost enthusiastic)
					Always the same.

			Cross walks on. Gittes follows.

							GITTES
					(not one to let it
					go)
					Always?

							CROSS
					What? Oh, damn near -- yes.
					Unless the animal's sick or
					something.
						(stops and glances.
						back)
					-- And the steam rising off it
					like that in the morning -- that's
					life, Mr. Gittes. Life.

			They move on.

							CROSS
						(continuing)
					Perhaps this preoccupation with
					horseshit may seem a little
					perverse, but I ask you to
					remember this -- one way or
					another, it's what I've dealt
					in all my life. Let's have
					breakfast.

		144  EXT. COURTYARD VERANDA - GITTES & CROSS AT BREAKFAST

			Below them is a corral where hands take Arabians, one by
			one, and work them out, letting them run and literally
			kick up their heels. Cross' attention is diverted by
			the animals from time to time. An impeccable Mexican
			butler serves them their main course, broiled fish.

							CROSS
					You know, you've got a nasty
					reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like
					that.

							GITTES
						(dubious)
					Thanks.

							CROSS
					-- If you were a bank president
					that would be one thing -- but
					in your business it's admirable.
					And it's good advertising.

							GITTES
					It doesn't hurt.

							CROSS
					It's why you attract a client
					like my daughter.

							GITTES
					Probably.

							CROSS
					But I'm surprised you're still
					working for her -- unless she's
					suddenly come up with another
					husband.

							GITTES
					No -- she happens to think the
					last one was murdered.

			Cross is visibly surprised.

							CROSS
					How did she get that idea?

							GITTES
					I think I gave it to her.

			Cross nods.

							CROSS
					Uh-huh -- oh I hope you don't
					mind. I believe they should be
					served with the head.

		145  Gittes glances down at the fish whose isinglass eye
			is glazed over with the heat of cooking.

							GITTES
					-- Fine, as long as you don't
					serve chicken that way.

							CROSS
						(laughs)
					Tell me -- what do the police
					say?

							GITTES
					They're calling it an accident.

							CROSS
					Who's the investigating officer?

							GITTES
					Lou Escobar -- he's a Lieutenant.

							CROSS
					Do you know him?

							GITTES 
					Oh yes.

							CROSS
					Where from?

							GITTES
					-- We worked Chinatown together,

							CROSS
					Would you call him a capable man?

							GITTES
					Very.

							CROSS
					Honest?

							GITTES
					-- Far as it goes -- of course
					he has to swim in the same water
					we all do.

							CROSS
					Of course -- but you've got no
					reason to think he's bungled
					the case?

							GITTES
					None.

							CROSS
					That's too bad.

							GITTES
					Too bad?

							CROSS
					It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It
					makes me think you're taking my
					daughter for a ride -- financially
					speaking, of course. How much are
					you charging her?

							GITTES
						(carefully)
					My usual fee -- plus a bonus
					if I come up with any results.

							CROSS
					Are you sleeping with her? Come,
					come, Mr. Gittes -- you don't have
					to think about that to remember,
					do you?

			Gittes laughs.

							GITTES
					If you want an answer to that
					question I can always put one
					of my men on the job. Good
					afternoon, Mr. Cross.

							CROSS
					Mr. Gittes! You're dealing with
					a disturbed woman who's lost her
					husband. I don't want her taken
					advantage of. Sit down.

							GITTES
					What for?

							CROSS
					-- You may think you know what
					you're dealing with -- but
					believe me, you don't.

		146  This stops Gittes. He seems faintly mused by it.

							CROSS
					Why is that funny?

							GITTES
					It's what the D.A. used to tell
					me about Chinatown.

							CROSS
					Was he right?

			Gittes shrugs.

							CROSS
						(continuing)
					... Exactly what do you know
					about me, Mr. Gittes?

							GITTES
					Mainly that you're rich and too
					respectable to want your name in
					the papers.

							CROSS
						(grunts, then)
					'Course I'm respectable. I'm
					old. Politicians, ugly buildings
					and whores all get respectable if
					they last long enough. I'll double
					whatever your fees are -- and I'll
					pay you ten thousand dollars if
					you can find Hollis' girlfriend.

							GITTES
					His girlfriend?

							CROSS
					Yes, his girlfriend.

							GITTES
					You mean the little chippie he
					was with at the El Macando?

							CROSS
					Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't
					she?

							GITTES
					-- Yeah.

							CROSS
					Doesn't that strike you as odd?

							GITTES
					No. She's probably. scared to
					death.

							CROSS
					Wouldn't it be useful to talk to 
					her?

							GITTES
					Maybe.

							CROSS
					If Mulwray was murdered, she was
					probably one of the last people
					to see him.

							GITTES
					You didn't see Mulwray much, did
					you?

							CROSS
					-- No --

							GITTES
					-- When was the last time?

		147  Cross starts to reply, then there's the SOUND of a
			MARIACHI BAND and some men in formation clear a bluff
			about a hundred yards off. They are dressed like
			Spanish dons on horseback. For the most part they are
			fat in the saddle and pass along in disordered review
			to the music..

							CROSS
					Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of
					damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece
					to the sheriff's re-election. I
					let 'em practice up out here.

							GITTES
					-- Yeah. Do you remember the
					last time you talked to Mulwray?

			Cross shakes his head.

							CROSS
					-- At my age, you tend to lose
					track...

							GITTES
					Well, It was about five days ago.
					You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle
					-- and you had one hell of an
					argument.

			Cross looks to Gittes in some real surprise.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					I've got the photographs in my
					office -- if they'll help you
					remember. What was the argument
					about?

							CROSS
						(a long pause, then:)
					My daughter.

							GITTES
					What about her?

							CROSS
					-- Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes
					I think she is frightened and I
					happen to know Hollis was fond of
					her. I'd like to help her if I
					can.

							GITTES
					I didn't realize you and Hollis
					were so fond of each other.

		148  Cross looks hatefully at Gittes.

							CROSS
					Hollis Mulwray made this city --
					and he made me a fortune... We
					were a lot closer than Evelyn
					realized.

							GITTES
					-- If you want to hire me, I
					still have to know what you and
					Mulwray were arguing about.

							CROSS
						(painfully)
					Well... she's an extremely jealous
					person. I didn't want her to find
					out about the girl.

							GITTES
					How did you find out?

							CROSS
					I've still got a few teeth in my
					head, Mr. Gittes -- and a few
					friends in town.

							GITTES
					Okay -- my secretary'll send you
					a letter of agreement. Tell me
					-- are you worried about that girl,
					or what Evelyn might do to her?

							CROSS
					Just find the girl.

							GITTES
					-- I'll look into it -- as soon
					as I check out some avocado groves.

							CROSS
					Avocado groves?

							GITTES
					We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.

		149  INT. HALL OF RECORDS - DAY

			Dark and quiet except for the whirring of fans. Gittes
			approaches one of the CLERKS at a desk.

							GITTES
					I'm a little lost -- where can I
					find the plat books for the
					northwest valley?

			The Clerk's droopy eyes widen a little.

							CLERK
					Part of it's in Ventura County.
					We don't have Ventura County in
					our Hall of Records.

			Which is a snotty remark. Gittes smiles.

							GITTES
					I'll settle for L.A. County.

							CLERK
						(regards him, then)
					Row twenty-three, section C.

			The Clerk turns away abruptly. Gittes regards his back
			a moment, then goes to the stacks.

		150  THROUGH THE STACKS

			Gittes sees the Clerk turn to another, say something.
			The second clerk gets on the phone. Gittes watches a
			moment, then swiftly turns his attention to the stacks.

			He hauls down the northwest valley volume, opens it.
			It's huge and there's a lot to go through.

			The print itself makes him squint.

			INSERT PAGE

			showing TRACT, LOT, PARCEL, even a METES AND BOUNDS 
			designation where the description of the land parcel is 
			long and hopelessly involved -- e.g. '6000 paces to Rio 
			Seco, thence 7000 paces to Loma Linda, etc.' These 
			Descriptions are old and faded -- in the owners' column, 
			however -- there are numerous freshly-typed names - 
			pasted over the prior owners.

		151  GITTES

			Hauls the huge volume back to the Clerk's desk.

							GITTES
						(to Clerk)
					Say... uh... sonny.

		152  The Clerk turns sharply around.

							GITTES
					How come all these new names are
					pasted into the plat book?

							CLERK
					Land sales out of escrow are
					always recorded within the week.

			Gittes looks a little surprised.

							GITTES
					Then these are all new owners?

							CLERK
					-- That's right.

							GITTES
						(astonished)
					-- But that means that most of
					the valley's been sold in the
					last few months.

							CLERK
					If that's what it says.

							GITTES
					Can I check one of these volumes
					out?

							CLERK
						(quietly snotty)
					Sir, this is not a lending library,
					it's the Hall of Records.

							GITTES
					Well, then -- how about a ruler?

							CLERK 
					A ruler?

							GITTES
					The print's pretty fine. I forgot
					my glasses. I'd like to be able
					to read across.

			The exasperated Clerk reaches around -- rummages -- slaps
			a ruler on the desk.

			Gittes goes back to the stacks with the ruler. He opens
			the book, places the ruler not horizontally but
			vertically.

		153  OMITTED

		154  INSERT PLAT BOOK NORTHWEST VALLEY

			Beside the OWNER column he places the ruler, looks toward
			the clerks -- then swiftly rips down the page, tearing
			out a strip about two inches wide -- containing the
			owner's name and property description.
			As he tears, he either sniffles or coughs -- to cover
			the SOUND of the PAPER being ripped.

		155  EXT. ROAD - GITTES DRIVING - DAY

			amidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat, parched and
			drying groves, narrower roads.

			He passes a ramshackle home, next to a rotting orchard.
			There is a "SOLD" sign on the collapsing barn. Gittes
			stops -- checks it against the names he had taken from
			the Hall of Records.

		156  OLD STUCCO BUILDINGS FURTHER ON.

			and a few withered pepper trees. Gittes has paused at
			this dried-up intersection. There is a "SOLD" sign on a
			drug store. Gittes looks O.S.

			Coming INTO VIEW above the arid fields is a spiraling
			cloud of purple smoke. Gittes heads in that direction.

		157  OMITTED

		158  Gittes parks at the edge of the field. About twenty
			yards away is a man mounted on a strange machine, holding 
			a lid off it -- billowing lavender clouds are belching
			forth.

			Several CHILDREN are watching the man at work.

							GITTES
						(to one of the Children)
					Say, pal, what's he doing?

							CHILD
					Making some rain.

			Gittes nods, walks over to the man who is elaborately
			busying himself with the intricacies of his machine.
			He's aware of Gittes watching him.

							GITTES
					Well, you're just the man I'm
					looking for.

			The Rainmaker now glances down at Gittes, who as usual
			is immaculately dressed.

							GITTES
					Some associates and I are thinking
					of buying property out here -- of
					course, we're worried about the
					rainfall.

			The Rainmaker steps down.

							RAINMAKER
				No problem with me on the Job.

							GITTES
					-- Yeah.
						(glancing around
						at the desolate,

					Do you have any references?

		159  RAINMAKER & GITTES

							RAINMAKER
					City of La Habra Heights -- filled
					an 800,000 gallon reservoir with
					sixteen inches of rain in two
					days.

							GITTES
						(nods)
					That's swell. But how about
					here?
						(pulling out names
						from his pocket)
					Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma
					Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian
					Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?

							RAINMAKER
					Never heard of 'em... new owners?

							GITTES
					-- Yeah.

							RAINMAKER
						(climbing back .up)
					Lot of turnover these days.
					Better tell them to get in touch
					with me if they want to hang onto
					their land.

							GITTES
					-- Yeah, I'll do that.

		160  GITTES DRIVING

			is now covered with a film of dust:

			He reaches a fork in the dirt road. There are a couple 
			of mailboxes.

			Gittes takes this fork and begins a slow ascent.

			As he does, the tops of a line of bright green trees
			can be SEEN, coming more and more INTO VIEW, row upon
			row of avocado and walnut groves, their foliage heavy.
			The few structures in the distance are white-washed,
			and well kept, right down to the white-washed stones
			that mark the pathway to the home. Towering above it
			all is a huge wooden water tank.

			Gittes drives through a gate that has "NO TRESPASSING"
			and "KEEP OUT -- PRIVATE PROPERTY" signs neatly printed
			on it.

			He drives down the road into the grove.

		161  GITTES

			pulls to a halt in the road flanking the orchard lanes.
			He puts the car in neutral, stares at the trees. By
			contrast with what he has seen -- they are lush and
			beautiful, their heavy branches barely swaying in a
			light breeze,

			Then a SHOTGUN BLAST abruptly strips bare the branches.
			of the tree he'd been staring at.

		162  EXT. AVOCADO GROVES - DAY

			Gittes is shocked. He looks behind him. Riding on
			horseback down the field in the direction he had just
			driven is a Red-Faced Man in overalls. His hat blows
			off his head. He does not, however, lose the shotgun
			he has just used. Gittes' lane of retreat is denied
			him. He guns the car, and takes off down one of the
			orchard lanes.

		163  MOVING WITH GITTES

			The dirt lane is rough. As Gittes nears the end of
			it, a Younger Man on a mule blocks the exit.

			Gittes veers a sharp left, knocking a branch off one
			of the trees, heading down one of the cross-lanes. Here
			he's pursued by a scraggly dog that nips at the tires.
			Gittes yells at it.

		164  ANGLE ON GROVE

			Two farmers on foot, one using a crutch, run down the
			lanes toward a dust trail rising above the trees --
			they've spotted it -- clearly it's from Gittes' car.

			This hide-and-seek chase between one man on horseback,
			one on a mule and a couple on foot continues up and
			down and across the orchard lanes -- until Gittes'
			front tire and radiator are ruptured by another
			SHOTGUN BLAST.

			Gittes' car veers off, scattering a stray gaggle of
			geese -- and smacks into an avocado tree, shaking loose
			a barrage of the heavy fruit onto Gittes and the car.

			Gittes immediately tries to get out through the branches
			over the back of his car, but he's pulled off it by one
			of the younger farmers -- a huge brute who he begins to
			tussle with -- the Crippled Farmer begins to bang Gittes
			on the back with his crutch. The two of them manage to
			pound Gittes to the ground within moments, where the
			Crippled Farmer continues to whack away at Gittes with
			the crutch.

			The older Red Faced Farmer with the shotgun and the Man
			on a mule ride up.

							RED FACED FARMER
					All right, quit it! Quit now!
					Search the man, see if he's armed.

		165  Gittes is hefted half off the ground and the two younger
			Farmers spin him around, going through his clothes.
			Gittes is badly banged up and half out on his feet.
			They toss his wallet, his silver cigarette case, etc.
			on the ground.

							RED FACED FARMER
					I said see if he's armed, not empty
					his pockets.

							BIG FARMER
					-- He ain't armed.

			Gittes leans against the back of his car, breathing
			heavily.

							RED FACED FARMER
					All right, mister -- who you with
					-- water department or the real
					estate office --

			Gittes' back is to the Red Faced Farmer. He has trouble
			catching his breath. The Crippled Farmer pokes him rudely in 
			the back with his crutch. Gittes turns sharply.

							GITTES
						(to Crippled Farmer)
					Get away from me!

							CRIPPLED FARMER
					Answer him!

							GITTES
					Touch me with that thing again and
					you'll need a pair of them.

							BIG FARMER
						(shoving Gittes)
					Whyn't you pick on somebody your
					own size?

							RED FACED FARMER
					I said cut that out! Give him
					a chance to say something.

			Gittes looks up at the Red Faced Farmer.

							GITTES
						(reaching down for
						his wallet)
					Name's Gittes -- I'm a private
					investigator and I'm not with
					either one.

							RED FACED FARMER
					Then what are you doing out here?

							GITTES
					-- Client hired me to see...
					whether or not the water department's
					been irrigating your land.

							RED FACED FARMER
					Irrigating my land?
						(exploding)
					The water department's been sending
					you people to blow up my water
					tanks! They threw poison down
					three of my wells! I call that
					a funny way to irrigate -- who'd
					hire you for a thing like that?

		166  Gittes reaches into his pocket -- the paper's on the
			ground. He picks it up.

							GITTES
					Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray --

							BIG FARMER
					Mulwray? That's the son of a
					bitch who's done it to us.

							GITTES
					Mulwray's dead -- you don't know
					what you're talking about, you dumb
					Oakie --

			The Big Farmer takes a swing at Gittes. Gittes kicks him
			squarely in the nuts, knees him in the jaw after he's
			doubled up, and hits him solidly. The Crippled Farmer
			takes careful aim and brings his crutch down on the back
			of Gittes' head. Gittes is knocked to the ground and
			lies still beside the Big Farmer who is writhing in agony
			in the dirt.

							RED FACED FARMER
					Well -- that's that.

		167  BLACK SCREEN

			There's a PURLING SOUND, which soon becomes defined into
			the SOUND OF VOICES talking quietly -- about whether to
			move or not to move, doctors, etc.

		168  CLOSE - EVELYN MULWRAY

			is staring down at Gittes who's lying in the screened-in
			porch of the farmers. His wife, the Red Faced Farmer,
			and the Big Farmer are there, along with the dog.

			The Red Faced Farmer's wife has set tea out. The farmers
			-- all of them -- now seem awkward and a little
			embarrassed.

		169  FRONT PORCH - RED FACE FARMER'S HOUSE -
			REACTION - GITTES - DUSK

			He focuses on Evelyn who sits right next to him. He's
			got dried blood down the side of his face from his nose,
			a huge mouse on his cheek, and his clothes are torn in
			a couple of spots.

							GITTES
						(to Evelyn)
					What's going on?

							DUBOIS
						(quietly, almost as
						if he were in a
						hospital)
					-- You didn't look too good, so we
					thought we better call your employer.

			Gittes nods. He checks his watch. He looks out -- It's
			almost evening. Gittes says nothing. The wife of the
			Red Faced Farmer (DUBOIS) looks reproachfully at Dubois.
			Gittes feels the back of his head, It obviously hurts 
			him.

		170  EXT. DUBOIS FARMHOUSE - EVENING

			Evelyn and Gittes go out to her car, the cream colored
			Packard. Dubois accompanies them -- along with the Big
			Farmer who is carrying a crate of something. Gittes has
			cleaned himself up a little.

							DUBOIS
					-- Look here, if it's all the same
					with you, we'll get your car patched
					up --If you'll tell me what your
					trousers run you, I'll make good on
					them, Mr. Gittes.

							GITTES
					It's okay, Mr. Dubois.

							DUBOIS,
						(to Evelyn)
					-- It's just that they're after
					everybody out here, tearing up our
					irrigation ditches -- trying to make
					our land worthless so they can pick
					it up for twenty-five dollars an
					acre --

			Gittes nods.

							DUBOIS
						(continuing)
					Anyway -- Earl here is sorry, too.
					He wants to give you something to
					take back with you.

			Gittes looks. Earl has the huge crate he's holding brim-
			full of avocados.

							GITTES
					Thanks, Earl.

		171  INT. CAR - EVELYN & GITTES - DUSK
		
			Evelyn driving.

							GITTES
					Thanks for coming...

			Gittes pulls out cigarette case, takes one -- offers one
			to Evelyn who refuses.

							GITTES
					-- That dam is a con job.

							EVELYN 
					What dam?

							GITTES
					The one your husband opposed --
					they're conning L.A. into building
					it, only the water won't go to
					L.A. -- it'll go here.

							EVELYN
					The Valley?

							GITTES
					Everything you can see, everything
					around us -- I was at the Hall of
					Records today --
						(whips out papers,
						turns on the car
						light)
					-- That bother you?

							EVELYN
					No.

							GITTES
						(looking over papers)
					In the last three months, Robert
					Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma
					Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer
					5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar
					Crabb 25,000 acres.

							EVELYN
					Jasper Lamar Crabb?

							GITTES
					Know him?

							EVELYN
					No, I think I'd remember.

							GITTES
					Yeah -- they've been blowing these
					farmers out of here and buying
					their land for peanuts -- Have
					any idea what this land'll be worth
					with a steady water supply? About
					thirty million more than they paid.

							EVELYN
					-- And Hollis knew about it?

							GITTES
					It's why he was killed -- Jasper
					Lamar Crabb -- Jasper Lamar Crabb --

			He's pulling out his wallet, excitedly now, spilling its
			contents onto the seat. He pulls out the obituary column
			he'd folded up earlier in the day.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					We got it. We got it, baby.

							EVELYN
					What? What is it?

							GITTES
					There was a memorial service at
					the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper
					Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks
					ago.

							EVELYN
					Is that unusual?

							GITTES
					Two weeks ago he bought those
					25,000 acres. That's unusual.

		172  EXT. MAR VISTA INN AND REST HOME - NIGHT

			Evelyn's car pulls up before the elegant Spanish rest
			home, its entryway illuminated by streetlights. There
			is a small sign giving the name of the place in elegant
			neon scroll. It sits on the rolling green lawns.

			Gittes gets out of the car with Evelyn. He offers her
			his arm and they go up the walkway to the entrance.

		173  INT. MAR VISTA INN AND REST HOME - NIGHT

			Gittes and Evelyn are approached by an unctuous man in
			his forties, with a flower in his buttonhole. He sees
			Evelyn first --

							PALMER
					Hello there, I'm Mr. Palmer. Can
					I help you folks?

			Then he gets a clear look at Gittes -- bruised, trousers
			torn, etc.

							GITTES
					Yes, I sure hope so. It's Dad --
						(indicating his
						disheveled appearance)
					-- I just can't handle him anymore,
					can I, sweetheart?

			Evelyn shakes her head.

							PALMER
					Oh my goodness.

							GITTES
						(hastily)
					Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, 
					actually.

							EVELYN
					They just don't get along very well.
					Dad's a lamb with anyone else.

							PALMER
						(not so sure)
					Oh -- well -- I don't know --

							GITTES
					Naturally, I want the best for him,
					money is no object -- 

							PALMER
					-- Perhaps if we could meet your
					father --

							GITTES
					There's just one question.

							PALMER
					Of course.

							GITTES
					Do you accept anyone of the Jewish
					persuasion?

			Evelyn can't quite conceal her surprise at the question.

							PALMER
						(very embarrassed)
					I'm sorry -- we don't.

							GITTES
						(smoothly)
					Don't be sorry, neither does Dad.
					Wanted to make sure though, didn't
					we, honey?

		174  Evelyn stares back at Gittes, amused and appalled.
			She manages to nod.

							GITTES
					Just to be certain, I wonder if
					you could show us a list of your
					patients?

							PALMER
						(polite but pointed)
					We don't reveal the names of our
					guests as a matter of policy. I
					know you'd appreciate that if your
					father came to live with us.

			Gittes locks eyes with Palmer.

							GITTES
						(confidentially)
					That's exactly what we wanted to
					hear.

							PALMER
					Oh, good.

							GITTES
					I wonder, is it too late for us
					to have a look around?

							PALMER
					I don't think so -- be happy to
					show you --

							GITTES
					Would you mind if we took a stroll
					on our own?

							PALMER
					-- Just, if you will, confine
					yourself to the main building --
					it's nearly bedtime.

							GITTES
					We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.

			He takes Evelyn.

		175  INT. PARLOR - EVELYN

			looking. Either by accident or design, the primarily
			octogenarian guests have segregated themselves. In one
			wing, the men are playing pinochle, some are playing
			dominoes -- one elderly gentleman sits. by himself 
			carefully peeling an orange.

			In an adjacent parlor several white-headed ladies work
			on a quilt.

			Gittes grabs Evelyn's hand.

							GITTES
						(quietly)
					They're all here. Every goddam
					name.

			Gittes points to the wall -- it says ACTIVITIES BOARD.
			There are titles -- LAWN BOWLING - BRIDGE - FISHING -
			CROQUET -- below them are the names of the guests,
			entered under certain activities, for certain days.

			After Evelyn looks, she turns to Gittes.

							GITTES
						(continuing;
						indicating the
						ancients around
						them)
					You're looking at the owners of
					a 50,000 acre empire.

							EVELYN
						(astonished)
					They can't be.

							GITTES
					They may not know it -- but they are.

		176  Gittes strolls toward the women knitting and working on
			the quilt.

							GITTES
					Hello, girls.

			Two of the ladies giggle. The third continues to busy
			herself with her quilt, off by herself.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					Which one of you is Emma Dill?

			Two of them say "she is," and point in different 
			directions. The third gives them a curt look and 
			goes back to her knitting. Gittes approaches her.

							GITTES
					Are you Emma?

			Some old voice is singing softly, "Don't Sit Under the
			Apple Tree."

							EMMA
					-- Yes.

							GITTES
					I've been wanting to meet you.

							EMMA
					Why?

							GITTES
					-- Did you know that you're a very
					wealthy woman?

							EMMA
						(stitching, smiles)
					-- I'm not.

							GITTES
					Well you own a lot of land.

							EMMA
					Not anymore. Oh, some time ago,
					my late husband owned a good deal
					of beach property in Long Beach --
					but we lost it.

			Gittes looks at the quilt. In it is the head of a fish
			-- among the rest of the crazy quilt pattern. Gittes
			spots it.

							GITTES
					That's just lovely.

							EMMA
					Thank you...

		177  He looks through the quilt for other pieces of the fish
			-- comes across the tail -- and by it -- the initials 
			A.C.

							GITTES
						(indicating tail)
					-- Where did you get this material?

							EMMA
						(what it sounds like)
					The apple core club --

							GITTES
					-- The apple core?

							EMMA
					No -- the albacore. It's a fish.
					My grandson's a member -- and they
					take very nice care of us.

							GITTES
					How do they do that?

							EMMA
					Give us things -- not just some
					old flag like this, but --

							GITTES-
						(kneeling)
					But what?

							PALMER'S VOICE
					We're a sort of unofficial charity
					of theirs, Mr. Gittes. Would you
					care to come this way? Someone
					wants to see you.

			Gittes looks up, sees Palmer standing in the doorway,
			looking taut and a little drawn. Evelyn is beside him.
			She gestures -- as if there's someone behind Palmer.

			Gittes rises.

							GITTES
					See you later, Emma.

			He walks toward Palmer who waits for him to walk in
			front.

		178  AT THE ENTRANCE HALL - MULVIHILL

			Is waiting. He's got his hand in his pocket. Evelyn
			looks to Gittes. The four of them stand there, Mulvihill
			towering over everyone.

							MULVIHILL
					Come on -- I want you to meet
					somebody, Gittes.

							GITTES
						(glancing from Palmer
						to Mulvihill)
					Can -- we leave the lady out of
					this?

							MULVIHILL
						(a little uncertain)
					-- Yeah, why not?

							GITTES
					Okay, I'd like to walk her to her
					car.

							EVELYN
					I'll stay.

						GITTES
						(taking her by the
						arm)
					Get in the car.

						MULVIHILL
					I'll see she makes it.

			Mulvihill has walked up beside Gittes. He makes the 
			mistake of opening the glass door in the entryway, 
			putting his back to Gittes for a moment. Gittes swiftly
			pulls Mulvihill's jacket up over his head. He spins him
			around. With his jacket covering his face, Gittes hammers
			away at Mulvihlll, beating him against the glass door, 
			along the wall, mercilessly pounding his fists into the 
			cloth until the cloth turns red and Mulvihill begins to 
			sink to the red tile floor. Palmer screams. Evelyn stands 
			there astonished. Mulvihill's gun has clattered to the 
			floor.

							GITTES
						(as Mulvihill hits
						the floor, to Evelyn)
					What are you waiting for? Get in
					the car!

			Evelyn goes.

		179  Mulvihill tries to get up again. Palmer starts to go for
			the gun, nearly picking it up. Gittes slaps it out of
			his hand and kicks it. It goes flying down the hall, at
			least thirty feet; hits the wall. Palmer goes screaming
			off into the night. Gittes turns back to Mulvihill who
			starts to get up, then collapses.

			Gittes goes out the front door, ignoring the excited
			audience of ancients behind him.

		180  OUTSIDE

			As Gittes walks down the pathway, he stops -- two men are
			coming toward him. One of them is shorter, and has the
			nervous, jerky moves of the man who slit his nose.

			Gittes stops. The two men fan out and continue to move
			toward him. Gittes spots the two-tone shoes. He begins 
			to back up.

			Suddenly there is a pair of headlights flashing
			brilliantly behind the two men. In a moment Evelyn's car 
			is headed across the lawn directly toward the two men,
			accelerating as it gets near them. They look in 
			disbelief, then dive for safety. The car skids to a stop,
			fishtailing a little on the grass.

			Evelyn opens the passenger door.

							EVELYN
					Get in.

			Gittes jumps in and she takes off across the lawn, 
			tilting the elegant little neon sign on the lawn as 
			she goes. Two SHOTS ARE FIRED.

		181  INT. CAR - EVELYN & GITTES

			Evelyn looking straight ahead, driving. After a moment
			she takes one hand off the wheel and rubs her left eye a
			little. Gittes watches her. He smiles.

		182  EXT. VERANDA - MULWRAY HOME - NIGHT

			Gittes stands on the veranda, smoking a cigarette, 
			staring off into the night.

			Evelyn comes out to the veranda, carrying a tray with
			whiskey and an ice bucket on it. She sets it down --
			Gittes turns.

							GITTES
						(watching her pour)
					Maid's night off?

							EVELYN
					Why?

							GITTES
						(a little surprised,
						he laughs)
					What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's
					here, that's all.

							EVELYN
						(handing Gittes his
						drink)
					-- I gave everybody the night off --

							GITTES
					-- Easy, It's an innocent question.

							EVELYN
					No question from you is innocent,
					Mr. Gittes.

							GITTES
						(laughing)
					I guess not -- to you, Mrs. Mulwray.
					Frankly you really saved my a--
					my neck tonight.

			They drink.

							EVELYN
					Tell me something -- does this
					usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?

							GITTES
					What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?

							EVELYN
					-- Well, I'm only judging on the
					basis of one afternoon and an evening,
					but if that's how you go about your
					work, I'd say you're lucky to get
					through a whole day.

						GITTES
						(pouring himself
						another drink)
					-- Actually this hasn't happened
					to me in some time.

							EVELYN
					-- When was the last time?

							GITTES 
					Why?

							EVELYN
					Just -- I don't know why.
					I'm asking.

			Gittes touches his nose, winces a little.

							GITTES
					It was in Chinatown.

							EVELYN
					What were you doing there?

							GITTES
						(taking a long drink)
					-- Working for the District Attorney.

							EVELYN 
					Doing what?

		183  Gittes looks sharply at her. Then:

							GITTES
					As little as possible.

							EVELYN
					The District Attorney gives his
					men advice like that?

							GITTES
					They do in Chinatown.

			She looks at him. Gittes stares off into the night.

			Evelyn has poured herself another drink.

							EVELYN
					Bothers you to talk about it,
					doesn't It?

			Gittes gets up.

							GITTES
					No -- I wonder -- could I -- do
					you have any peroxide or something?

			He touches his nose lightly.

							EVELYN
					Oh sure. C'mon.

			She takes his hand and leads him back into the house.

		184  INT. BATHROOM - MIRROR

			Gittes pulls the plaster off his nose, stares at it in
			the mirror. Evelyn takes some hydrogen peroxide and some
			cotton out of a medicine cabinet. Evelyn turns Gittes'
			head toward her. She has him sit on the pullman tile
			adjacent to the sink.

							EVELYN
					Doctor did a nice job...

			She begins to work on his nose with the peroxide. Then 
			she sees his cheek -- checks back in his hair.--


							EVELYN
						(continuing)
					-- Boy oh boy, you're a mess

							GITTES
					-- Yeah --

							EVELYN
						(working on him)
					-- So why does it bother you to
					talk about it... Chinatown...

							GITTES
					-- Bothers everybody who works
					there -- but to me -- It was --

			Gittes shrugs.

							EVELYN
					-- Hold still -- why?

							GITTES
					-- You can't always tell what's
					going on there --

							EVELYN
					... No -- why was it --

							GITTES
					I thought I was keeping someone
					from being hurt and actually I ended
					up making sure they were hurt.

							EVELYN
					Could you do anything about it?

		185  They're very close now as she's going over a mouse very
			near his eye.

							GITTES
					Yeah -- make sure I don't find
					myself in Chinatown anymore --
					wait a second --

			He takes hold of her and pulls her even closer,

							EVELYN
						(momentarily freezing)
					-- What's wrong?

							GITTES
					Your eye.

							EVELYN
					What about it?

							GITTES
						(staring intently)
					There's something black in the
					green part of your eye.

							EVELYN
						(not moving)
					Oh that... It's a flaw in the
					iris...

							GITTES
					... A flaw...

							EVELYN
					(she almost shivers)
					... Yes, sort of a birthmark...

			Gittes kisses her lightly, gradually rises until he's
			standing holding her. She hesitates, then wraps her arms
			around him.

		186  INT. MULWRAY BEDROOM - TELEPHONE

			on a nightstand, city lights visible through the open
			window behind it. It is RINGING. Evelyn's arm reaches
			INT0 SHOT. SOUND of something hitting the headboard.
			Gittes moans.

			VIEW SHIFTS TO INCLUDE Gittes in bed, holding his head,
			which he's just hit. Evelyn pauses in her reach to the
			phone. She turns to him, whispers, "I'm sorry," kisses
			him on the head and lips. PHONE CONTINUES TO RING. She
			picks it up.

							EVELYN
					Hello...
						(in Spanish now)
					No, no, I'll come and help,
					just keep watching her and don't
					do anything until I get there...
					'bye.

			VIEW SHIFTS AGAIN TO INCLUDE Gittes in bed, watching
			Evelyn next to him as she's talking on the phone. She
			hangs up. She touches Gittes' cheek lightly.

							EVELYN
					I have to go.

			Gittes stares at her silently.

							GITTES
					Where?

							EVELYN
					-- Just -- I have to.

							GITTES
					And I want to know where.

							EVELYN
						(she starts out of
						bed)
					Please don't be angry... believe
					me, it's got nothing to do with
					you --

							GITTES
						(stopping her)
					Where are you going?

							EVELYN
						(near tears)
					Please!... Trust me this much...
						(she kisses him
						lightly)
					I'll be back -- look, there is
					something I should tell you. The
					fishing club that old lady mentioned,
					the pieces off the flag --

							GITTES
					The Albacore Club.

							EVELYN
					It has to do with my father.

							GITTES 
					I know.

							EVELYN
					He owns it. You know?

							GITTES
					I saw him.

							EVELYN
						(sitting up straight)
					You saw my fa -- father? When?

							GITTES
					This morning.

							EVELYN
						(panicked)
					You didn't tell me.

							GITTES
					There hasn't been a lot of time.

		187  She leaps out of bed, throwing on a robe.

							EVELYN
					What did he say?
						(insistent)
					What did he say ?

							GITTES
					-- That you were jealous, and
					he was worried about what you
					might do.

							EVELYN
					Do? To who?

							GITTES
					Mulwray's girlfriend, for one
					thing. He wanted to know where
					she was.

			Evelyn starts quickly for the bathroom, then comes back
			and kneels by the side of the bed, takes Gittes' hand.

							EVELYN
					I want you to listen to me -- my
					father is a very dangerous man.
					You don't know how dangerous. You
					don't know how crazy.

							GITTES
					Give me an example.

							EVELYN
					You may think you know what's going
					on, but you don't.

							GITTES
					That's what your father said --
					you're telling me he's in back of
					this whole thing?

							EVELYN
					It's possible.

							GITTES
					Including the death of your husband?

							EVELYN
					It's possible -- please don't ask
					me any more questions now. Just
					wait, wait for me -- I'll be back.
					I need you here.

			She kisses him, rushes to the bathroom, shuts the door.
			Gittes stares at it a moment. Then leaps out of bed,
			rummages around, tosses on his trousers. He grabs his
			shoes, throws them on. Then hurries out of the bedroom.

		188  EXT. MULWRAY HOME - GITTES

			running across the driveway to the garage. There are two
			cars there -- Mulwray's Buick and Evelyn's Packard.

			Gittes moves over to the Buick, opens the passenger's
			door.

		189  INT. BUICK - GITTES

			checks the ignition. No key is in it. He pulls a couple
			of wires from under the dash -- starts to mess with them,
			seems satisfied. Slides out across the seat, slams the
			door.

		190  EXT. MULWRAY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

			Gittes hurries over to the Packard. He gets down on the
			driveway, lying on his back, bracing himself. With the
			heel of his shoe, he kicks at the right rear taillight of
			the car. He shatters the red lens, gets up. He carefully
			pulls the red lens off the taillight, exposing the white
			light beneath it. He tosses the red lens into the 
			shrubbery and hurries back toward the house.

		191  ONE RED AND ONE WHITE TAILLIGHT - MOVING - NIGHT

			Evelyn's car speeds along the curves on Sunset Boulevard,
			the red and white lights coming IN AND OUT OF VIEW.

		192  GITTES DRIVING - NIGHT

			behind the wheel of Mulwray's car, keeping a healthy
			distance from Evelyn in front of him. .

		193  EVELYN'S PACKARD

			pulls up before a small little bungalow-house. She gets
			out, looks up and down the street. There is nothing.
			She hurries on up the walkway to the front door.

		194  DOWN THE STREET - GITTES IN BUICK

			Idles the engine with the lights off. He brings the car
			a few yards further down the street, parking it near
			Evelyn's.

			Gittes gets out of the car and goes up the walkway. 
			The curtains are drawn except for one of the small 
			windows on the side of the house. He goes to it and 
			looks, balancing on the edge of the porch.

		195  THROUGH THE WINDOW

			Gittes sees Evelyn's Oriental servant rush through the
			living room of the small house. In a moment he re-emerges
			back through the living room carrying a tray with a glass
			and pitcher on it.

		196  GITTES

			around to the side of the house. He runs into shrubbery
			and a short picket fence.

			He climbs over it, follows along the stucco wall to a
			series of windows at the corner of the house. These all
			have shades on them. He can hear someone crying in the
			house. Someone else talking alternately firmly and 
			plaintively in Spanish. Here the windows have blinds. 
			He moves to one where the blind is not completely drawn 
			-- there's an inch or so of space at the bottom.

		197  THROUGH THE WINDOW

			Gittes can see the servant again. Evelyn is pacing back
			and forth in and out of his line of vision. After a 
			moment someone rises INTO SHOT -- obviously from lying 
			on a bed. The figure is just a few feet from Evelyn. Her
			tear-stained face comes INTO VIEW. It is unmistakably 
			the girl Gittes had last seen with Hollis Mulwray. 
			Mulwray's girlfriend. She's looking up to Evelyn, 
			speaking in Spanish -- her words are not discernible 
			but the tone is -- bitter, anguished. A newspaper is 
			strewn about the room.

			Evelyn kneels. She insists that the girl swallow down
			some pills. The girl reluctantly does.

		198  GITTES

			continues to watch.

		199  EXT. STREET - EVELYN - NIGHT

			emerges from the house, goes to her car and gets in.

		200  INT. CAR

			Evelyn sees Gittes sitting in her car, staring coldly
			at her.

							GITTES
					Okay, give me the keys.

							EVELYN
						(stunned, furious)
					You bastard.

							GITTES
					-- It's either that or you drive
					to the police yourself..

							EVELYN
					The police?

							GITTES
					C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray -- you've got
					your husband's girlfriend tied up
					in there!

							EVELYN
					She's not tied up!

							GITTES
					You know what I mean. You're
					keeping her there against her will.

							EVELYN
					I am not!

							GITTES
					Then let's go talk to her.

		201  Gittes starts to get out of the car. Evelyn grabs his
			arm, nearly screaming:

							EVELYN
					No!

			Her intensity actually rips Gittes' already partially
			torn jacket. He looks at it and her. It seems to have
			a momentary calming effect on both of them.

							EVELYN
						(continuing)
					She's too upset.

							GITTES
					What about?

							EVELYN
					Hollis' death. I tried to keep
					it from her, I didn't want her
					upset before I could make plans
					for her to leave.

							GITTES
					You mean she just found out?

							EVELYN
					Yes.

							GITTES
					That's not what it looks like,
					Mrs. Mulwray.

							EVELYN
					What does it look like?

							GITTES
					Like she knows about Hollis' death
					-- like she knows more than you
					want her to tell.

							EVELYN
					You're insane.

			Gittes explodes.

							GITTES
					Just tell me the truth -- I'm not
					the police. I don't care what
					you've done. I'm not going to
					hurt you -- but one way or another
					I'm going to know.

							EVELYN
					You won't go to the police if I
					tell you?

							GITTES
					I will if you don't.

			A long pause. Evelyn's head sinks onto the steering
			wheel, her hair covering her face.

							EVELYN
					She's my sister.

		202  Evelyn is breathing very deeply now -- not crying, but
			the kind of deep breathing that comes from real hysteria.
			Gittes puts an arm on her shoulder.

							GITTES
					Take it easy... If it's your sister
					it's your sister... why all the
					secrecy?

			She lifts her head and looks up at him. He's genuinely
			puzzled.
							EVELYN
						(really upset)
					I can't...

							GITTES
					Because of Hollis? Because she
					was seeing your husband? Was that
					it? Jesus Christ, say something.
					Was that it?

			She nods. Gittes sighs.

							EVELYN
						(finally)
					I would never ever have harmed
					Hollis. I loved him more than my
					own family. He was the most gentle,
					decent man imaginable... and he
					put up with more from me than
					you'll ever know... I just wanted
					him to be happy...

			She begins to cry softly.

							GITTES
						(after a moment)
					-- I took your husband's Buick...
						(he opens the car
						door)
					I'll return it tomorrow.

							EVELYN
					Aren't you coming back with me?

							GITTES
					-- Don't worry. I'm not telling
					anybody about this.

							EVELYN
					... That's not what I meant.

			There is a long moment of silence. Gittes looks over to
			Evelyn. Her hair covers most of her face from him.

							GITTES
						(finally)
					Yeah, well... I'm very tired,
					Mrs. Mulwray. Good night.

			He gets out and slams the car door. She drives off.

		203  INT. SHOWER - GITTES' APARTMENT - GITTES

			The spray is hitting him full on the top of the head.
			Gittes is so exhausted he's literally holding onto the
			nozzle as the water pours down. He shuts the shower off,
			reaches weakly for a towel -- dabs his nose lightly with
			it.

		204  INT. GITTES' BEDROOM - GITTES

			pads around in elegant silk pajamas.

			He walks over to the window where morning light is 
			streaming in. He closes the curtains, collapses on the 
			bed, on top of the covers, inert. Almost immediately the
			PHONE RINGS. Gittes lets it go on for a moment, then
			picks it up without saying anything.

							VOICE ON PHONE
						(male)
					Gittes?... Gittes?

							GITTES
					-- Yeah.

							VOICE ON PHONE
					Ida Sessions wants to see you.

							GITTES
					Who?

							VOICE 0N PHONE
					Ida Sessions, you remember Ida.

			Gittes slowly rises to one elbow.

							GITTES
					-- Yeah?... I do?

							VOICE ON PHONE
					Sure you do.

							GITTES
					-- Well, tell you what, pal. If
					Ida wants to see me she can call
					me -- at my office.

			He hangs up, falls back down. PHONE RINGS AGAIN.
			AND AGAIN. Gittes swears, picks it up.

							VOICE ON PHONE
					684 1/2 East Tensington -- Echo
					Park. She begged me to call.
					She's waiting for you.

			Before Gittes can say anything, the phone clicks dead.

		205  EXT..CERRITOS TOWER ROAD - HOLLYWOOD HILLS - 
			EARLY MORNING

			Gittes pulls up. It is a bungalow courtyard with a
			very narrow walkway and sickly green stucco.

		206  EXT. IDA SESSIONS' APARTMENT - DAY

			Gittes at the front door. It's slightly ajar. He knocks.
			Nothing. He opens it and enters.

		207  INT. LIVING ROOM

			Morning light filters through the half-open blinds. Dust
			particles in the shafts of light. It's still and empty.
			Gittes sees something down the hall, under the legs of a
			telephone table. Gittes moves toward it. It is grotesque.
			When he gets closer he can see it's a wilted head of
			lettuce. Just inside the kitchen some radishes and onions
			lie on the linoleum. Gittes walks on into the kitchen.

		208  INT. KITCHEN

			Clearing the kitchen counter, Gittes sees IDA SESSIONS
			lying on her back on the floor, surrounded by the 
			groceries from a broken bag. Ice cream has melted around 
			her. Her eyes are open, a stream of ants is moving across 
			the ice cream and into her mouth. She's recognizable as
			the woman who posed as Evelyn Mulwray.

			Gittes kneels over her. He gingerly opens her handbag,
			fishes for its contents, takes them and looks at them on
			the kitchen counter -- wallet with a few bills in it,
			driver's license. with her name -- a Screen Actors Guild
			card. Gittes nods -- turns, carefully replaces the items
			in the purse.

			He idly opens the broom closet, pantry, and even 
			Frigidaire -- which is all but empty. Then he steps over 
			her body and moves across the hall to a door that is
			slightly ajar.

		209  INT. BATHROOM

			Gittes enters and turns on the light.

							ESCOBAR
					Find anything interesting, Gittes?

			Escobar and another PLAINCLOTHED MAN stand in the 
			bathroom by the entrance to the bedroom door. Gittes 
			turns around. A THIRD MAN is now coming down the hall 
			from the bedroom.

			Gittes looks at the two, doesn't reply.

							ESCOBAR
					What are you doing here?

							GITTES
					Didn't you call?

							ESCOBAR
						(jerk of his head
						toward the kitchen)
					How do you happen to know her?

							GITTES 
					I don't.

							ESCOBAR
					(turning toward
					other room)
					-- Let me show you something.

		210  INT. KITCHEN

			Escobar points to the number MU 7279 on the side of one
			of the kitchen cabinets.

							ESCOBAR
					Isn't that your number?

							GITTES
					Is it? I forget. I don't call
					myself that often.

							ESCOBAR
					Just to be on the safe side, we
					had Loach here give you a ring.

			He indicates one of his assistants.

							ESCOBAR'S ASSISTANT
						(a slight sneer)
					What happened to your nose, Gittes?
					Somebody slam a bedroom window on it?

							GITTES
						(right back, smiling)
					Nope, your wife got excited, crossed
					her legs a little too quick. You
					understand, pal.

			The Assistant starts to move for Gittes who is ready for
			him. Escobar steps between the two.

							ESCOBAR
						(to other Assistant)
					Loach.
						(Escobar pulls out
						a drawer)
					How about these? Look familiar?

			In the open drawer are the photos of Mulwray and the
			girl in the park, boat, and at the El Macando on the
			veranda.

							GITTES
						(no point in denying it)
					Yeah, I took 'em. So what?

							ESCOBAR
					How did she --
						(meaning the corpse)
					-- happen to have them?

			Gittes takes a deep breath.

							GITTES
					Either you tell me or I guess -
					'cause I don't have the answer.

			Escobar nods.

							ESCOBAR
					You really think I'm stupid, don't
					you, Gittes?

							GITTES
					I don't think about it one way or
					the other. But if you want, give
					me a day or two, and I'll get
					back to you. Now I'd like to go
					home.

							ESCOBAR
					I want the rest of the pictures.

							GITTES
					What pictures?

							ESCOBAR
						(meaning the corpse)
					This broad hired you, Gittes, not
					Evelyn Mulwray.

							GITTES 
					Yeah?

							ESCOBAR
					Yeah -- somebody wanted to shake
					down Mulwray, she hired you, and
					that's how you happen to know
					Mulwray was murdered.

							GITTES
					I heard it was an accident.

							ESCOBAR
					C'mon, you think you're dealing
					with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray
					had salt water in his goddam lungs!
					Now how did he get that... in a fresh
					water reservoir?

		211  Gittes is surprised at this piece of information, but
			remains nonplussed.

							ESCOBAR
					You were following him night and
					day You saw who killed him.
					You even took pictures of it.
					It was Evelyn Mulwray -- she's
					been paying you off like a slot
					machine ever since her husband
					died.

							GITTES
						(smiling)
					You accusing me of extortion?

							ESCOBAR
					Absolutely.

							GITTES
					-- I don't think I need a day or
					two -- you're even dumber than
					you think I think you are. Not
					only that, I'd never extort a nickel
					out of my worst enemy, that's where
					I draw the line, Escobar.

							ESCOBAR
					Yeah, I once knew a whore who for
					enough money would piss in a
					customer's face -- but she'd never
					shit on his chest. That's where
					she drew the line.

							GITTES
						(smiling)
					Well, I hope she wasn't too much
					of a disappointment to you, Lou.

			Escobar manages a thin smile.

							ESCOBAR
					I want those photographs, Gittes.
					We're talking about accessory after
					the fact, conspiracy, and extortion
					-- minimum.

							GITTES
					Why do you think Mulwray's body
					was moved you dimwit? Evelyn
					Mulwray knocked off her husband
					in the ocean -- and thought it
					would look like more of an accident
					if she hauled him up to the Oak
					Pass Reservoir?

			This is a little telling.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					Mulwray was murdered and moved --
					because somebody didn't want his
					body found in the ocean.

							ESCOBAR
					And why's that ?

							GITTES
					He found out somebody was dumping
					water there. That's what they
					were trying to cover up by moving
					him.

			This stops Escobar. He's dumbfounded by it.

							ESCOBAR
					What are you talking about?

							GITTES
					C'mon I'll show you.
		
			Escobar hesitates.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					C'mon - make a decision, Lou.
					You're in charge.

			The men around Escobar look to him. Escobar grudgingly
			nods.

		212  CLOSE SHOT - STORM DRAIN

			It yawns AT CAMERA, only a trickle of water dropping into
			the ocean.

			VIEW WIDENS TO INCLUDE Escobar, Gittes, and two Plain-
			clothesmen, standing and staring at the empty pipe as if
			they expect it to talk.

							GITTES
						(squinting in sunlight)
					It's too late.

							ESCOBAR
					Too late for what?

							GITTES
					They only dump the water at night.

		213  A THIRD ASSISTANT runs down the side of the cliff and 
			Over to Escobar.

							ESCOBAR
					Reach anybody?

							THIRD ASSISTANT
					Yelburton, he's the new chief.

							ESCOBAR
					I know who he is. Well?

							THIRD ASSISTANT
					He says --

							GITTES
					I know what he says.

							ESCOBAR
						(to Gittes)
					Shut up.
						(to Assistant)
					Go on.

							THIRD ASSISTANT
					Yelburton says they're irrigating
					in the valley -- there's always a
					little runoff when they do that.
					And he says is Gittes knows that,
					and has been going around making
					irresponsible accusations for the
					last week.

			Escobar turns to Gittes. Stares at him for a long moment.

							ONE OF ASSISTANTS
					Let's swear out a warrant for her
					arrest. What are we waiting for?

							GITTES
						(meaning Escobar)
					-- Because he just made lieutenant,
					and he wants to hang onto his
					little gold bar.

			Escobar stares hatefully at Gittes.

							ESC0BAR
					Have your client in my office in
					two hours -- and remember. I
					don't have to let you go. I've
					got you for withholding evidence
					right now.

		214  EXT. MULWRAY HOME - DAY

			Gittes in Mulwray's Buick whips into the driveway. He
			looks in the garage. Evelyn's car is gone. Only the
			Gardener's truck is there.

			Gittes hurries along the pathway and up to the house.
			He rings the doorbell. Scarcely waiting for an answer
			he tries it. It's locked. He reaches into his pocket
			-- pulls out his cigarette case, takes a pick out of
			the side and starts to fool with the lock.

			The Maid opens the door abruptly, stares in some surprise
			at Gittes.

							GITTES
					Where's Mrs. Mulwray?

							MAID
					No esta.

		215  Gittes looks past the Maid to the center of the living
			room -- where luggage is packed and neatly piled.

			The Maid is actually in the process of throwing covers
			over the furniture.

							GITTES
						(indicating luggage)
					Is Mrs. Mulwray going someplace?...
						(no answer)
					on a trip?... vacation?...

							MAID
					No esta in casa.

			Gittes nods. He continues through the house and out back
			to the veranda.

		216  EXT. MULWRAY VERANDA - GITTES

			is unsettled. Sees the Gardener working by the pond.
			He wanders a few yards in that direction.

		217  GARDENER

			spots Gittes, half-bows, nods and smiles.

		218  GITTES

			in turn, nods, smiles.

							GITTES
					-- bad for glass.

		219  GARDENER

			breaks into a big grin. Nods again.

							GARDENER
					Oh yes, bad for glass.

		He points to the newly mown lawn.

							GARDENER
						(continuing)
					Salt water velly bad for glass.

		220  GITTES

			can't quite believe what he's heard,

							GITTES
					Salt water?

			The Gardener nods vigorously. Points to the pond.

							GARDENER
					Velly velly bad.

			Gittes has moved to the pond. He kneels. Clinging to the
			edge of it he can now see as he could have before if he'd
			looked closely, a starfish.

		221  CLOSE STARFISH

			It has one leg missing. The fifth point on the star is
			Just beginning to grow back.

		222  GITTES

			touches the water, tastes it. He licks his lips, then
			spots something glinting in the bottom of the pond.

							GITTES
					What's that... down there?

			The Gardener peers into the pond.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					... there.

			The Gardener spots it. He rolls up his trousers, gets in
			the pond, and reaches into the bottom, his chin actually
			touching the water. He misses the object, which seems to
			scoot away like an animal. Then he grasps it. He lifts it 
			out of the water and holds a pair of eye glasses, 
			rimless, bent, his finger poking through the frame where 
			one lens is shattered.

			The Gardener seems surprised. Gittes looks at the 
			glasses. They are heavily bifocal and reflect the sun.

		223  INT. MULWRAY HOME

			Gittes holds the phone to his ear. On the telephone 
			table, lying on his handkerchief are the glasses.

			The Maid hovers around over Gittes' shoulder, uneasily
			watching him.

							CROSS' VOICE
					Hello.

							GITTES
					Have you got your checkbook handy,
					Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.

							CROSS' VOICE
					-- you've got her? Where?

							GITTES
					Do you remember the figures we
					discussed?

							CROSS' VOICE
					Of course I do. Where are you?

							GITTES
					-- at your daughter's house.
					How soon can you get here?

							CROSS' VOICE
					Two hours... tell me, will
					Evelyn be there as well?

							GITTES
					Either that or she'll be in jail.

							CROSS' VOICE
					What are you talking about?

							GITTES
					Just bring your checkbook.

			Gittes hangs up.

		224  EXT. BUNGALOW-HOUSE - ADELAIDE DRIVE

			Gittes pulls up in Mulwray's Buick. He hurries to the 
			front door, pounds on it.

			The Chinese servant answers the door.

							CHINESE SERVANT
					You wait.

							GITTES
						(short sentence in
						Chinese)
					You wait.

		225  Gittes pushes past him. Evelyn, looking a little worn but
			glad to see him hurries to the door. She takes Gittes' 
			arm.

							EVELYN
					How are you? I was calling you.
		
			She looks at him, searching his face.

							GITTES
					-- Yeah?

			They move into the living room. Gittes is looking around
			it.

							EVELYN
					Did you get some sleep?

							GITTES
					Sure.

							EVELYN
					Did you have lunch?
					Kyo will fix you something --

							GITTES
						(abruptly).
					-- where's the girl?

							EVELYN
					Upstairs. Why?

							GITTES
					I want to see her.

							EVELYN
					...she's having a bath now... why
					do you want to see her?

			Gittes continues to look around. He sees clothes laid out
			for packing in a bedroom off the living room.

							GITTES
					Going somewhere?

							EVELYN
					Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to
					catch. Why?

			Gittes doesn't answer. He goes to the phone and dials.

							GITTES
					J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant
					Escobar

							EVELYN
					What are you doing? What's wrong?
					I told you we've got a 4:30 --

							GITTES
						(cutting her off)
					You're going to miss your train!
						(then, into phone)
					Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide
					-- it's above Santa Monica
					Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.

							EVELYN
					What did you do that for?

							GITTES
						(a moment, then)
					You know any good criminal lawyers?

							EVELYN
						(puzzled)
					-- no...

							GITTES
					Don't worry -- I can recommend a
					couple. They're expensive but you
					can afford it.

							EVELYN
						(evenly but with
						great anger)
					What the hell is this all about?

			Gittes looks at her -- then takes the handkerchief out 
			Of his breast pocket -- unfolds it on a coffee table, 
			revealing the bifocal glasses, one lens still intact. 
			Evelyn stares dumbly at them.

							GITTES
					I found these in your backyard --
					in your fish pond. They belonged to
					your husband, didn't they?... didn't
					they?

							EVELYN
					I don't know. I mean yes, probably.

							GITTES
					-- yes positively. That's where
					he was drowned...

							EVELYN
					What are you saying?

							GITTES
					There's no time for you to be
					shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray.
					The coroner's report proves he was
					killed in salt water. Just take my
					word for it. Now I want to know
					how it happened and why. I want
					to know before Escobar gets here
					because I want to hang onto my
					license.

							EVELYN
					-- I don't know what you're talking
					about. This is the most insane...
					the craziest thing I ever...

			Gittes has been in a state of near frenzy himself.
			gets up, shakes her.

							GITTES
					Stop it! - I'll make it easy. --
					You were jealous, you fought, he
					fell, hit his head -- it was an
					accident -- but his girl is a
					witness. You've had to pay her
					off. You don't have the stomach
					to harm her, but you've got the
					money to shut her up. Yes or no?

							EVELYN
					... no...

							GITTES
					Who is she? And don't give me that
					crap about it being your sister.
					You don't have a sister.

			Evelyn is trembling.

							EVELYN
					I'll tell you the truth...

			Gittes smiles.

							GITTES
					That's good. Now what's her name?

							EVELYN
					-- Katherine.

							GITTES
					Katherine?... Katherine who?

							EVELYN
					-- she's my daughter.

		226  Gittes stares at her. He's been charged with anger and
			when Evelyn says this it explodes. He hits her full in
			the face. Evelyn stares back at him. The blow has forced
			tears from her eyes, but she makes no move, not even to
			defend herself.

							GITTES
					I said the truth!

							EVELYN
					-- she's my sister --

			Gittes slaps her again.

							EVELYN
						(continuing)
					-- she's my daughter.

			Gittes slaps her again.
							EVELYN
						(continuing)
					-- my sister.

			He hits her again.

							EVELYN
						(continuing)
					My daughter, my sister --

			He belts her finally, knocking her into a cheap Chinese
			vase which shatters and she collapses on the sofa,
			sobbing.

							GITTES
					I said I want the truth.

							EVELYN
						(almost screaming it)
					She's my sister and my daughter!

			Kyo comes running down the stairs.

							EVELYN
						(continuing;
						in Chinese)
					For God's sake, Kyo, keep her
					upstairs, go back!

			Kyo turns after staring at Gittes for a moment then
			goes back upstairs.

							EVELYN
						(continuing)
					-- my father and I, understand,
					or is it too tough for you?

			Gittes doesn't answer.

							EVELYN
						(continuing)
					... he had a breakdown... the
					dam broke... my mother died...
					he became a little boy... I was
					fifteen... he'd ask me what to
					eat for breakfast, what clothes
					to wear!... It happened... then
					I ran away...

							GITTES
					to Mexico...

			She nods.

							EVELYN
					Hollis came and took... care
					of me... after she was born...
					he said... he took care of her...
					I couldn't see her... I wanted to
					but I couldn't... I just want to
					see her once in a while... take care
					of her... that's all... but I don't 
					want her to know... I don't want 
					her to know...

							GITTES.
					... so that's why you hate him...

			Evelyn looks slowly up at Gittes.

							EVELYN
					-- no... for turning his back on
					me after it happened! He couldn't
					face it...
						(weeping)
					I hate him.

			Gittes suddenly feels the need to loosen his tie.

							GITTES
					-- yeah... where are you taking her
					now?

							EVELYN
					Back to Mexico.

							GITTES
					You can't go by train. Escobar'll
					be looking for you everywhere.

							EVELYN
					How about a plane?

							GITTES
					That's worse... Just get out of
					here -- walk out, leave everything.

							EVELYN
					I have to go home and get my things --

							GITTES
					-- I'll take care of it.

							EVELYN
					Where can we go?

							GITTES
					...where does Kyo live?

							EVELYN
					-- with us.

							GITTES
					On his day off. Get the exact
					address.

							EVELYN
					-- okay...

			She stops suddenly.

							EVELYN
					Those didn't belong to Hollis.

			For a moment Gittes doesn't know what she's talking 
			about. Then he follows her gaze to the glasses lying on 
			his handkerchief.

							GITTES
					How do you know?

							EVELYN
					He didn't wear bifocals.

			Gittes picks up the glasses, stares at the lens, is
			momentarily lost in them.

		227  EVELYN
		
			from the stairs. She has her arm around Katherine.

							EVELYN
					Say hello to Mr. Gittes, sweetheart.

							KATHERINE
						(from the stairs)
					Hello.

		228  GITTES

			rises a little shakily from the arm of the sofa.


							GITTES
					Hello.

			With her arm around the girl, talking in Spanish, 
			Evelyn hurries her toward the bedroom. In a moment she 
			re-emerges.

							EVELYN
						(calling down)
					-- he lives at 1712 Alameda... do
					you know where that is?

		229  REACTION - GITTES

			He nods slowly.

							GITTES
					-- sure. It's Chinatown.

		230  THRU WINDOW

			of bungalow Gittes watches Evelyn, the girl and Kyo head
			for Kyo's black dusty sedan.

			Gittes drops the curtain, heads swiftly to the phone. He
			dials.

							GITTES
					Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah,
					listen, pal, Escobar's going to try
					and book me in about five minutes...
					relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the
					office for two hours. If you don't
					hear from me, you and Duffy meet me
					at 1712 Alameda.

							WALSH'S VOICE
					-- Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't
					it?

		231  The front BELL RINGS.

							GITTES
					I know where it is! Just do it.

			Gittes hangs up and goes to the door. He opens it. No
			one is there.

							GITTES
						(not even bothering
						to look around the
						sides)
					Come on in, Lou -- we're both too
					late.

			Escobar and his minions appear from either side of the
			door.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					Looks like she flew the coop.

			Escobar nods.

							ESCOBAR
					I don't suppose you got any idea
		W			here she went?

							GITTES
					Matter of fact I do.

							ESCOBAR
					Where?

							GITTES
					Her maid's house. I think she
					knows something's up.

							ESCOBAR
					What's the maid's address?

							GITTES
					She lives in Pedro -- I'll write it
					down for you --

							ESCOBAR
					No, Gittes, you'll show us.

							GITTES 
					What for?

							ESCOBAR
					If she's not there, you're going
					downtown, and you're staying there
					til she shows up.

							GITTES
						(deliberately
						petulant)
					Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.

							ESCOBAR
						(shoving him toward
						the door)
					Tell us about it on the way to
					Pedro.

		232  EXT. SAN PEDRO - 29TH STREET - DAY

			A steep hill overlooks part of the harbor. Escobar's
			unmarked car pulls up to a stop in front of a Spanish
			duplex perched on the steep hillside.

							ESCOBAR
					That's it?

							GITTES
					-- yeah.

							ESCOBAR
					Well, let's go.

							GITTES
					Do me a favor, will you, Lou?

			Escobar waits.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					Let me bring her down myself...
					she's not armed or nothing... she
					won't be any problem... I'd just
					like a minute alone with her...
					It would mean something... to...
					her... and to me.

			Escobar shakes his head. For a moment it looks like it
			means no.

							ESCOBAR
					You never learn, do you,
					Gittes?

							GITTES
						(a little
						chagrined)
					I guess not.

							ESCOBAR
					-- Give you three minutes.

							GITTES
					Gee, thanks, Lou.

			Gittes gets out of the car, glances around, goes up the 
			stairs. He looks back down at Escobar. Gittes rings the 
			bell. He waits. It opens. It's a WOMAN who's not 
			recognizable. She's got the remnants of a black eye.

							WOMAN
					Yes?...

			Gittes looks past her to Curly, the fisherman from the
			first scene. He's seated at the dinner table with his
			father, his mother, and his children. Curly looks up in
			surprise.

							CURLY
						(happily)
					Mr. Gittes! Come in, come in.

		233  Gittes enters and closes the door. Curly rises and comes
			over to him, greets him happily.

							CURLY
					Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.

							GITTES
					Call me Jake. How is everything?

							CURLY
					Just sitting down to supper, Jake.
					Care to join us?

							GITTES
					No thanks --

							CURLY
					How about a glass of wine? Honey,
					this is --

							WIFE
						(coolly)
					Yes, I know.

							GITTES
					Thanks just the same, Curly. I
					could use a glass of water, though --
					come out with me to the kitchen
					for a second.

							CURLY
						(puzzled)
					Sure thing.

		234  INT. KITCHEN - GITTES AND CURLY

							GITTES
					Curly, where's your car?

							CURLY
					In the garage.

							GITTES
					Where's that?

							CURLY
					Off the alley.

							GITTES
					Could you drive me somewhere?

							CURLY
					Sure, as soon as we eat --

							GITTES
					Right now, Curly. It can't wait.

							CURLY
					I'll just tell my wife.

							GITTES
						(pulling him out
						the back door)
					-- tell her later.

			They head out the back door and down the steps toward
			The garage.

		235  EXT. ALLEY AND GARAGE

			Curly pulls open the garage door. Gets in, starts the
			car, backs it out. It's an old, late twenties Plymouth
			sedan. Gittes hops in. They take off. At the edge of
			the alley Gittes looks back.

		POV FROM CURLY'S CAR

			Escobar is getting out of his car, moving towards the
			duplex. Gittes slips down in the seat.

							GITTES' VOICE
			Just drive slow for a block or two,
			will you, Curly?

							CURLY'S VOICE
					What's this all about?

							GITTES' VOICE
					Tell you in a couple of blocks.

		236  INT. SEDAN - GITTES AND CURLY

							GITTES
					How much do you owe me, Curly?

							CURLY
						(embarrassed)
					Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes -- we're going
					out tomorrow. I know you been real
					good about it but my cousin Auggie's
					sick.

							GITTES
					Forget it. How would you like to
					pay me off by taking a couple of
					passengers to Ensenada... you'd
					have to leave tonight.

							CURLY
					-- I don't know...

							GITTES
					-- I might be able to squeeze an
					extra seventy-five bucks out of it
					for you -- maybe an even hundred.

							CURLY
					-- plus what I owe you?

							GITTES
					I'll throw that in too.

							CURLY
						(smiling)
					Okay, you got yourself a boat.

		237  EXT. MULWRAY HOME - GITTES AND CURLY

			carry bags out to Curly's car. Curly opens the door for
			the Maid. She gets in. He turns to Gittes.

							GITTES
					Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half
					an hour after you get there -- then
					if I don't show, take her down to
					the boat.

							CURLY
						(a little worried)
					-- you sure this is okay?

							GITTES
						(mildly indignant)
					Curly, you know how long I been in
					business.

			Curly nods, reassured. He gets in and takes off.

		238  EXT. MULWRAY HOME - DUSK

			by the pond, cigarette smoke drifts INTO SHOT. A car
			pulls up. In a moment Cross can be SEEN, looking TOWARD
			CAMERA.

							CROSS
					There you are.

			He walks toward Gittes who stands by the pond, smoking.

							CROSS
						(continuing)
					Well, you don't look any the worse
					for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say...
					where's the girl?...

							GITTES
					I've got her.

							CROSS
					Is she all right?

							GITTES
					She's fine.

							CROSS
					Where is she?

							GITTES
					With her mother.

			Cross' tone alters here.

						CROSS
					... with her mother?

			Gittes pulls something out of his pocket and unfolds it.

							GITTES
					I'd like you to look at something,
					Mr. Cross --

							CROSS
						(taking it)
					What is it?

							GITTES
					An obituary column... can you read
					in this light?

							CROSS
					Yes... I think I can manage...

			Cross dips into his coat pocket and pulls out a pair of
			rimless glasses.. He puts them on, reads.

		239  GITTES

			stares at the bifocal lenses as Cross continues to look
			through the obituary column. He looks up.

							CROSS
					What does this mean?

							GITTES
					-- that you killed Hollis Mulwray --

			Gittes is holding the bifocals with the broken lens now.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
				-- right here, in this pond. You
				drowned him... and you left these.

			Cross looks at the glasses.

							GITTES
					...the coroner's report showed
					Mulwray had salt water in his
					lungs.

							CROSS
						(finally)
					Hollie was always fond of tide-pools.
					You know what he used to say about
					them?

							GITTES
					Haven't the faintest idea.

							CROSS
					-- that's where life begins...
					marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he
					was fascinated by them... you know
					when we first came out here .he
					figured that if you dumped water
					onto desert sand it would percolate
					down into the bedrock and stay
					there, instead of evaporating the
					way it does in most reservoirs.
					You'd lose only twenty percent
					instead of seventy or eighty. He
					made this city.

							GITTES
					-- and that's what you were going
					to do in the Valley?

		240  EXT. POND - CROSS AND GITTES

							CROSS
						(after a long moment)
					-- no, Mr. Gittes. That's what 
					I am doing with the Valley. The 
					bond issue passes Tuesday - 
					there'll be ten million to build 
					an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm 
					doing it.

							GITTES
					There's going to be some irate
					citizens when they find out they're
					paying for water they're not getting.

							CROSS
					That's all taken care of. You see,
					Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the
					water to L.A. -- or you bring L.A.
					to the water.

							GITTES
					How do you do that?

							CROSS
					-- just incorporate the Valley into
					the city so the water goes to L.A.
					after all. It's very simple.

			Gittes nods.

							GITTES
						(then)
					How much are you worth?

							CROSS
						(shrugs, then)
					I have no idea. How much do you
					want?

							GITTES
					I want to know what you're worth --
					over ten million?

							CROSS
					Oh, my, yes.

					GITTES
					Then why are you doing it? How
					much better can you eat? What can
					you buy that you can't already
					afford?

							CROSS
						(a long moment,
						then:)
					The future, Mr. Gittes -- the
					future. Now where's the girl?...
					I want the only daughter I have
					left... as you found out, Evelyn
					was lost to me a long time ago.

							GITTES
						(with sarcasm)
					Who do you blame for that? Her?

			Cross makes a funny little cock of his head.

							CROSS
					I don't blame myself. You see,
					Mr. Gittes, most people never
					have to face the fact that at
					the right time and right place,
					they're capable of anything. Take
					those glasses from him, will you,
					Claude?

			Mulvihill moves INTO VIEW. Extends his hand for the
			glasses. Gittes doesn't move.

							CROSS
						(continuing)
					It's not worth it, Mr. Gittes.
					It's really not worth it.

			Gittes hands over the glasses.

							CROSS
						(continuing)
					Take us to the girl. Either
					Evelyn allows me to see her, or
					I'm not averse to seeing Evelyn
					in jail -- if I have to buy the
					jail -- Hollis and Evelyn kept
					her from me for fifteen years --
					it's been too long, I'm too old.

		241  EXT. CHINATOWN STREET - NIGHT

			The streets are crowded. Here and there one can see
			Chinese in traditional dress.

		242  GITTES

			driving slowly -- spots Katherine with Ramon and luggage,
			nearly lost in the crowd. They are walking toward a car
			parked near a laundry truck.

			Gittes sees them, keeps driving.

							CROSS
						(suddenly)
					Stop the car. Stop the car!

			Mulvihill tries to clobber Gittes. Gittes elbows him.
			The car jumps the curb and hits a lamppost.

		243  EXT. STREET - CROSS

			leaps out of the car shouting:

							CROSS
					Katherine! Katherine! Wait!

			Gittes is after him, grabbing him. Cross tries to swing
			at Gittes with his cane. Mulvihill comes up behind Gittes
			and the three of them begin an awkward wrestling match,
			--the crowd scattering, Mulvihill pulling his revolver, 
			trying to hit Gittes on the side of the head. The three 
			men crash to the pavement.

		244  CURLY

			starts out of the car toward Gittes. Gittes sees him.

							GITTES
					No, Curly, get 'em out of here!
					Get 'em out of here:

			He bites Mulvihill's hand and furiously pounds it into 
			the sidewalk, shaking gun loose. Mulvihill and Gittes
			Try for it but someone else has it.

		245  EVELYN 

			Holds the gun. She's shaking but apparently in control
			of herself.

		246  GITTES

			rises to his feet. Mulvihill starts to help Cross up.

							EVELYN
					No, don't help him. Don't do
					anything.

			Mulvihill doesn't move. Cross rises on his own. Evelyn
			holds the revolver on him.

							EVELYN
						(continuing)
					-- she's gone. It's no good.

							CROSS
					Where?

							GITTES
						(moving to Evelyn)
					Let me handle that.

							EVELYN
						(to Gittes)
					I'm all right.
		
							GITTES
						(she's not)
					Sure, but I'd like to handle it.

			Evelyn backs up as her father takes a step toward her.

							CROSS
					You're going to have to kill me,
					Evelyn. Either that or tell me
					where she is.

			Evelyn is backing up. Cross moving on her. Evelyn cocks
			the pistol.

							CROSS
						(continuing)
					How many years have I got?...
					she's mine too.

							EVELYN
					-- she's never going to know that.

			There's the SOUND of a SIREN. Cross lunges toward her.
			Gittes grabs Cross.

			Duffy and Walsh are elbowing through the crowd.
			Gittes sees them.

							GITTES
					Duffy -- go over and sit on Mulvihill.
						(to Walsh)
					Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you
					to bring the police department
					with you.

							WALSH
					Jake -- it's Chinatown. They're
					all over-the place. You oughta
					know better.

							GITTES
						(to Walsh, meaning
						Cross)
					Gimme your keys. Watch this old
					fart, will you?
						(moving to Evelyn)
					Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's
					in Pedro, near the Starkist
					cannery. It's the Evening Star.
					He'll be waiting. I'll take
					care of this.

		247  She looks to Gittes. He looks at her. She turns and
			He looks at her. She turns and Escobar is standing 
			between her Escobar is standing between her and it.

							ESCOBAR
					Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to
					run around like that.

							GITTES
					Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't
					know what's going on. Let her go.
					I'll explain it later.

							ESCOBAR.
					Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious
					offense -- pointing that at an
					officer of the law. It's a felony.

							GITTES
					Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.

							ESCOBAR
						(starting toward her)
					I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray --

							GITTES
					Lou, she will kill you -- let her
					go for now. You don't know.

							ESCOBAR
					Gittes, stay outta this.

			Escobar continues to move toward her. Gittes grabs him.

							GITTES
						(to Evelyn)
					Now take off.

			Evelyn gets in the car. She starts it. Gittes lets
			Escobar go.

							ESCOBAR
					I'll just have her followed --
					she's not going anywhere --

			There's a single GUNSHOT. Both men look surprised. Down
			the block a uniformed officer has fired, standing beside
			his double-parked car. Duffy's sedan slows to a stop in
			the middle of the street. It jerks a couple of times,
			still in gear, then comes to a halt.

			Gittes rushes to the car. He opens it. Evelyn falls out,
			inert. Blood is pouring from her right eye.

						GITTES
						(yelling)
					No!

			He holds onto Evelyn as Escobar and others hurry up.
			Cross himself elbows through.

							GITTES
						(continuing)
					Where is he? I'll kill him, I'll
					kill the son of a bitch --

			Several officers contain Gittes.

							GITTES
						(continuing;
						to Escobar)
					Who is he, get his name? I'll kill
					him --

							ESCOBAR
						(badly shaken)
					Take it easy, take it easy, it was
					an accident --

							GITTES
					An accident --

			Gittes looks down. What he sees horrifies him. Cross is
			on the ground, holding Evelyn's body, crying.

							GITTES
					Get him away from her. He's
					responsible for everything. Get
					him away from her!

							ESCOBAR
						(stunned)
					Jake -- you're very disturbed.
					You're crazy. That's her father.

			Walsh and Duffy elbow through the crowd.

							ESCOBAR
						(continuing;
						to them)
					You wanna do your partner the
					biggest favor of his life? Take
					him home. Just get him the hell
					out of here!

			Duffy bear hugs the protesting Gittes, along with Walsh,
			literally dragging him away from the scene, with Gittes
			trying to shake free. Through the crowd noises, Walsh can
			be heard saying, "Forget it, Jake -- it's Chinatown."

							THE END
